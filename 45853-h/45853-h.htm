<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p class="indent">In claiming an impartial examination of so extraordinary
a carving as the "Lenape Stone" at the hands of archæologists,
the writer has had several difficulties to contend with.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>First</i>, The fact that the carving is quite unique, it being
the first aboriginal <i>carving</i> of the mammoth thus far
claimed to have been discovered in North America.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Second</i>, That no "scientific observer" was present at
the discovery.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Third</i>, That since its discovery the Stone has been
several times cleaned, and that thereby many geological
tests of its authenticity have been rendered impossible.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fourth</i>, That within the last few years, and
particularly in Philadelphia, serious frauds have been perpetrated upon
lovers of Indian relics.</p>

<p class="indent">These considerations may well have been sufficient to
prejudice the mind of a stranger against the alleged
wonderful Indian relic, yet they should in no case suffice
to prevent, on the part of the archæologists, a thorough
and impartial examination of all the evidence pertaining
to its discovery.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">In presenting this and other evidence, the writer has
wished only to be impartial, and to be led by the facts
as they have presented themselves, and for the examination
of which his opportunities have been peculiarly favorable.</p>

<p class="indent">In his knowledge of the neighborhood and its people
(his home), an acquaintance with all the persons concerned,
and very frequent visits to the Hansell Farm,
nothing has yet occurred to shake his faith in the
unimpeachable evidence of an honest discovery. Yet should
any fresh light be brought to bear upon the subject, however
at variance with this opinion, it will be welcomed.</p>

<p class="indent">The appearance in America of a carving of the hairy
mammoth, presumably the work of our aborigines, if not
a surprise to students of archæology, would certainly be
no less interesting than the French discoveries of some
twenty years ago; while the ready connection of the work
with the Indian of comparatively recent times, the appearance
of human figures in the carving, and of many symbols
which seem related to highly important branches of
archæological study, would awaken a more general and
enthusiastic interest in the Stone, than has been felt for
any other prehistoric representation of the great elephant.</p>

<p class="indent">A disbelief in its authenticity would leave us with an
interest, not inconsiderable, in the unknown person who,
after months of careful study and preparation, could have
conceived and executed so remarkable a fraud.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LENAPE_STONE" id="THE_LENAPE_STONE">THE LENAPE STONE.</a></h2>

<p class="indent">In the spring of 1872, eight years after the
discovery of the famous mammoth carving in the cave of La Madeleine,
Perigord, France, Barnard Hansell, a young farmer,
while ploughing on his father's farm, four miles and
a half east of Doylestown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania,
saw, to use his own words, a "queer stone" lying
on the surface of the ground, and close to the edge of the
new furrow. The plough had just missed turning it
under. He stopped and picked it up; it was the larger
piece of the fractured "gorget stone," in fig. 1, <a href="#Page_i">(frontispiece)</a>.
By wetting his thumb and rubbing it he could see
strange lines and a carving representing an animal like an
elephant, but without troubling his boyish head much about
it, he carried it several days in his pocket, and finally
locked it up in his chest, where, along with his other
relics, arrow-heads, spear-points, axes, and broken banner
stones, thrown in from time to time as he found them on
the farm, it remained until the spring of 1881, when he
sold it to Mr. Henry Paxon, son of a well-known resident
of the neighborhood, then a youth of nineteen, and with
a fancy for collecting Indian antiquities, in whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
possession it still remains.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
At the moment of the purchase
no particular attention had been paid to the carvings,
and the new owner was not certain that he had noticed
the mammoth while at Hansell's house, or until a few
hours later, when he had brought home his trophies and
shown them to his father, who distinctly remembers calling
his son's attention to the rude outline of an elephant
upon the stone.</p>

<p class="indent">But without doubt the singular part of the story
is the unexpected finding of the smaller piece of the fractured
stone a few months later. After many ineffectual searches
for it in the intervening years, it was picked up by Hansell
while corn-husking with his brother in the same field and
at the same spot where nine years before the first piece had
been found. This luckily discovered fragment Hansell
presented to Mr. Paxon. Several persons of the neighborhood
had seen the stone at Mr. Paxon's house both
before and after the discovery of the second piece, but it
was not until both parts had been some months in his possession
that any unusual interest was attached to it even by him.</p>

<p class="indent">Some time in July, 1882, Captain J. S. Bailey,
of the Bucks County Historical Society, to whom the writer in
preparing the present article must acknowledge his great
indebtedness, and who first called serious attention to the
archæological value of the stone, made it the subject of
a paper read before the Society, but since that time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
although displayed at a county exhibition and twice
shown at meetings of the Society above mentioned, this
remarkable relic has remained unheard of.</p>

<p class="indent">This is the simple story of most great archæological
discoveries; no "man of science" was at hand to analyze the
condition of the surrounding soil, or satisfy himself that a
fraud had not been committed, and a hundred questions
now arise as to the finder of the stone, and its present
owner, its long unrecognized importance, the whereabouts
of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, etc., etc. The "modern
scientist" will by no means be satisfied with such evidence
as would be held sufficient in a court of law, and
every fraud that has been perpetrated upon the lover of
Indian relics adds to the necessity of carefully examining
each detail of the discovery&mdash;nothing must be believed
except upon the strongest evidence.</p>

<p class="indent">For a full discussion of this evidence the
reader is referred to the <a href="#APPENDIX">appendix</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Several circumstances seem to concur in adding to
the novelty of the discovery. In the first place the carving has
been made upon one of the so-called "gorget stones," than
which no class of Indian relics have been more puzzling to
archæologists. Our museums are well-supplied with these
mysterious perforated tablets of slate, generally resembling
in size and shape the stone represented in <a href="#Page_i">fig. 1</a>,
and which are found in all parts of the United States. Ornaments,
talismans, breastplates, or buttons, as we may choose to call
them, they seem to have been the peculiar property of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
North American Indian, without a counterpart, as far as the
writer can learn, in the stone implements of other uncivilized
races. They seem often to have been buried with
the dead warrior and when discovered in Indian graves are
generally close to the breast of the skeleton.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
Gorgets are frequently scratched and scribbled upon, and
ornamental zig-zags and cross-lines, like the faint scratches
plainly to be seen on the Lenape stone crossing the
carvings in all directions, are not uncommon on these
stones, pipes, banner stones, and other Indian implements;
but picture-writings proper, such as are commonly found
painted upon buffalo robes, scratched upon birch bark, or
carved upon the face of cliffs or large boulders, are exceedingly
rare on small stones, and the tablet in question
is the only known instance, the writer believes, of a pictured
gorget. The carving, when compared with the
larger and more conventional Muzzinabiks or rock-writings
and birch-bark records of the Indians, seems to lack
much of the symbolic obscurity common to these productions
of the prophets and medicine men. It doubtless belongs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
to the less hieratic class of writings, known among
the Algonkins as "Kekeewin," which dealt with things
generally understood by the tribe.</p>

<p class="indent">It is unquestionably a picture of a combat
between savages and the hairy mammoth&mdash;an encounter such
as our imagination has not yet connected with the ancient
forests of America, and drawn as well as an Indian who
had seen the great monster could have drawn it. Most
of the figures seem represented according to the common
conventional method of the modern Indians, yet there is
certainly a seeming picturesque relation between them of
which we can find no example in the few ancient Indian
pictographs which have been preserved to us. We can
almost fancy a foreground, a distance, and a faint chiaro-oscuro.</p>

<p class="indent">The combat we might imagine takes place on the
confines of a forest, and if we may judge from an upward inclination
of the foreground on the right, at the base of a hillside.
The monster, angry, and with erect tail, approaches
the forest, in which, through the pine trunks, are seen the
wigwams of an Indian village. In the sky overhead, and as
if presiding over the event, are ranged the powers of
heaven: forked lightning flashes through the tree-tops, and
from between a planet and the crescent moon, beyond
which we seem to see a constellation (represented by a
series of crossed lines) and two stars, the sun's face looks
down upon the scene. Four human forms confront the
monster, the first holds in his right hand a bow from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
which the arrow just discharged is sticking in the side of
the enraged beast, and in his left, if it is not planted in
the ground, a long lance; a second warrior with head-dress
of feathers stands farther to the right; and still
farther, and near what may perhaps be called a rock, a
third sits upon the ground apparently smoking a pipe. A
fourth figure is easily distinguishable trampled under the
fore feet of the mammoth.</p>

<p class="indent">The strong effect upon the fancy of the rude
carving, as we gaze upon it, would be hard indeed to resist. Its
stern naïveté and characteristic lack of æsthetic purpose
bring upon the mind a haunting sense of the reality of
the event it represents, and our sympathies seem genuinely
awakened for the four human beings who have dared to
confront the monster with their rude weapons of stone,
yet whose destiny, like that of their huge antagonist, is
overshadowed by the near presence of a supernatural
power, seen in the great phenomena of nature which the
artist has connected with the scene. Well might the
appearance of the hairy mammoth have excited in the
superstitious mind of the Indian hunter fancies more
wild than those contained in the carving. Hardly more
thrilling could have been the coming of the white men in
ships, or the sound of their cannon, than the sight of one
of these ungainly monsters in the shadows of a primeval
forest, or the crash of his irresistible advance through the
underbrush.</p>

Beckendorff, a Russian engineer, who, in 1846, saw
a carcass entire, "a black, horrible, giant-like mass," floating
on one of the rivers of Siberia, declared that its appearance
to that of a modern Indian elephant was as "that
of a coarse ugly dray-horse to an Arab steed." He also
noticed a ridge of stiff hair like a mane about a foot in
length and extending above the shoulders and along the back.</p>

<p class="indent">Its size, like that of the modern elephant, must
have varied considerably. The famous St. Petersburg skeleton
measures but nine feet in height, while that in the Royal
Museum of Natural History in Brussels reaches eleven
feet, and the animal in the carving, judging from the
relative size of the figures, would have been still larger
than Beckendorff's carcass, which he declares measured
thirteen feet in height. Geology tells us much of the
aspect, epoch, habits, and range of the mammoth; that
it had appeared later than the mastodon, and somewhere
in the age known as the Pliocene; that there were several
species&mdash;three at least&mdash;two of which were inhabitants of
America; that in North America it ranged from Behring
Strait to the Gulf of Mexico, and in Europe from the
extremity of Eastern Siberia as far south as Rome and
the Pyrenees; that it fed upon the branches of the fir,
birch, poplar, willow, etc., and was probably migratory in
its habits, wandering toward grazing grounds in the north
in summer, and southward in winter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The long shaggy hair with which it was clothed,
distinguishing it in appearance from the modern elephant
and its smaller contemporary, the mastodon, was composed
of three distinct suits: the longest, rough, black
bristles, about eighteen inches in length; the next, a coat
of finer close-set hair, fawn-colored, from nine to ten
inches long; and the last, a soft, reddish wool, about
five inches long, filling up the interstices between the
other hair, and enabling the animal to withstand an arctic cold.</p>

<p class="indent">The enormous tusks measured along the curve from
eleven to fifteen feet, and curved quite abruptly outward and backward.</p>

<p class="indent">The massive grinder, sometimes weighing seventeen
pounds, was a conspicuous characteristic; the whole of
its surface was not brought into use at once, but successively,
new grinding-points being formed from behind as
the outer and older points wore away.</p>

<p class="indent">Several etymologies have been given for
the name "mammoth"; among others, the word "behemoth" in
the Book of Job, and the Arabic word "mehemot," signifying
an elephant of very large size. One of the most
interesting is the Tartar word "mamma," meaning the
earth, suggested by Pallas, a Russian scientist, who first
gave a description of the animal. "The Tungooses and
Yakoots," he says, "believed that this animal worked its
way in the earth like a mole. The mammoths had
retired, they say, into great caverns from which they
never emerge, but wander to and fro in the galleries;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and as they pass into one the roof of the gallery rises,
and the roof of the one just vacated sinks. The moment
this animal sees the light it dies, and the reason why so
many carcasses have been exposed to view is because of
their having been deceived by the irregular conformation
of the earth's surface, thus unintentionally venturing
beyond the confines of darkness."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Mastodon and mammoth bones have been discovered
in Europe from the earliest times, and a history of the
remarkable theories to which they had given rise before
the time of Cuvier is very interesting. By the learned of
by-gone times the fossils have been mistaken for the bones
of Ajax, the "body of Orestes," unicorns, the teeth of St.
Christopher, and the remains of Hannibal's elephants. The
middle ages have given us a whole library on the subject
of a race of giants, whose remains were clearly recognized
in the huge bones.</p>

<p class="indent">In America, in colonial times, Governor Dudley,
of Massachusetts, was "perfectly of opinion" that the mastodon
tooth discovered near Albany in 1705 "will agree
only to a human body, for whom the flood only could
prepare a funeral; and without doubt he waded as long
as he could keep his head above the clouds, but must at
length be confounded with all other creatures."</p>

<p class="indent">At what period the monster became extinct in
Europe is a question to which geology gives no answer from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
point of view of human history. The evidence rests upon
the variously computed age of the beds in which the
fossil bones occur. In France, for instance, it is known
that the mammoth, whose bones are found in the strata
underlying, and therefore older than, the Somme Valley
peat, became extinct before the peat stratum, thirty feet
thick, which contains no bones, had formed. It had grown,
says M. Boucher de Perthes, at the rate of three inches in
a hundred years; and if, as geologists say, the mammoth
bones of Niagara Falls were deposited in their bed before
six miles of the present river gorge were worn by the
cataract out of the solid rock, they may be, according to
Lyell, 31,000, or Desors, 380,000 years old.</p>

<p class="indent">In Siberia, whence most of our information comes,
many carcasses of these huge animals have been found preserved
entire in the frozen mud. When and how did they perish?
Possibly, says the geologist, all at once, overwhelmed
by some sudden cataclysm, which, burying the carcasses
in the mud, was immediately followed by an intense cold
that has lasted ever since; possibly, again, great freshets
in the northern rivers, overtaking the migrating herds,
swept their carcasses from warmer regions to the shores
of the Polar Sea.</p>

<p class="indent">In Europe, the fact that the mammoth survived
into the human period was proved some years ago by the
discovery of human stone implements associated with
mammoth bones in the river gravels of the Somme Valley,
France, and in the Virgin Cave at Brixham, South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Devon, England; but more interesting still, was the
discovery of prehistoric carvings of the great elephant,
sketches from nature made by the "cave-men," and found
in their subterranean dwellings along the river Dordogne
in France, illustrations of which will be given in the
following pages.</p>

<p class="indent">In America, we have traces of a race of savages
as old or older than the now famous river-drift and cave-men of
Europe. Since the "Calaveras Man" lived, a valley, say
geologists, has been metamorphosed, by the slow processes
of nature, into a mountain; and the "San Joachim plummet,"
the "Trenton gravel-flints," and stone implements
from the gold-bearing gravels of California, all speak of a
race of human beings who must have lived in the time of
the hairy mammoth.</p>

<p class="indent">But who were these people? Were they Indians?
or had the Indian or his ancestor the mound-builder not yet
appeared? and how many thousands or tens of thousands
of years ago did they exist? These are questions which
archæology has not yet answered.</p>

<p class="indent">Here, however, with the carving before us we need
not go back so far, nor beyond the Indian as we know him&mdash;the
fierce, roving, bauble-loving, picture-making hunter of to-day.
A study of the wonderful outlines on the stone will
lead us through a period of his history extending over
many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years before the
coming of Columbus; and here we may try to read, from
the few vestiges of this time that chance has preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to us, fragments of his picturesque mythology, strange
legends of his origin and wanderings over a forest-covered
continent, and the thrilling story of the mound-builders,
and of long wars when the forest soil for centuries was a
"dark and bloody ground."<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p class="indent">That the mammoth had survived into the time of
the Indian can hardly be doubted. Early travellers had frequently
seen its bones at the "Big-Bone Licks" in Kentucky,
whither the huge animals had come, like the deer
and buffalo of modern times, to lick the salt. The great
bones often seemed hardly older than those of the modern
animals with which they were mingled, and, judging from
their position along the modern buffalo-trails through the
forest, it seems that the latter animals had followed the
ancient tracks of the mammoth to and from the licks.</p>

<p class="indent">Not a few of these early travellers thought it
worth their while to question the Indians about the huge bones
and note down their answers. Jefferson, in his "Notes
on Virginia," devotes several pages to the subject. He
even believes the mammoth to be still in existence in his
time in some remote part of the American continent.
He tells the story of a Mr. Stanley, who, "taken prisoner
by the Indians near the mouth of the Tanissee," relates
that "after being transferred through several tribes from
one to another, he was at length carried over the mountains
west of the Missouri to a river which runs westwardly;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
that these bones abounded there, and that the
natives described to him the animal to which they belonged
as still existing in the northern parts of their
country, from which description he judged it to be an elephant."</p>

<p class="indent">Further, in support of his theory, he gives an
Indian tradition of a great monster known as the Big Buffalo,
and obtained, he says, from a Delaware chief by one of
the governors of Virginia during the American Revolution.
Nothing has seemed more interesting in a study of
the carvings on the Lenape Stone than the remarkable
similarity between this tradition of the Lenni Lenape or
Delawares and the carvings on this relic, discovered in the
middle of their ancient territory. The chief, as the account
runs, being asked as to the bones at the Big-Bone Licks in
Kentucky, says that it was a tradition handed down from his
fathers that "in ancient times a herd of these tremendous
animals came to the Big-Bone Licks and began a universal
destruction of the bear, deer, elks, buffaloes, and other
animals which had been created for the use of the Indians.
That the Great Man above, looking down and seeing this,
was so enraged that he seized his lightning, descended on
the earth, seated himself on a neighboring mountain, on a
rock on which his seat and the print of his feet are still to
be seen, and hurled his bolts among them till the whole
were slaughtered except the big bull, who, presenting his
forehead to the shafts, shook them off as they fell; but
missing one at length, it wounded him in the side, whereon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
springing around, he bounded over the Ohio, over the
Wabache, the Illinois, and finally over the great lakes,
where he is still living at this day."</p>

<p class="indent">Making due allowance for translation, and a
reasonable amount of garbling, the points of similarity between the
carving and the tradition&mdash;the great man above (the sun)
looking down, the lightning, and the big bull presenting
his forehead to the shafts, and at length wounded in the
side&mdash;are very striking; and if we compare the curious
circle enclosing a dot, on the inclined foreground to the
right, with the "neighboring mountain," and the
footprint on the rock of the tradition, the correspondence
seems again too unusual for mere coincidence. On the
other hand, the tradition says nothing of warriors or wigwams,
or of planets, moon, and stars, yet these differences
may naturally be accounted for if we suppose the stone
older than the tradition, and that in the latter the local
and matter-of-fact elements of time, place, and human
agency would have been the first to fade away as time
went on. But this is not the only Indian tradition of a
great monster&mdash;presumably the mammoth&mdash;which has
been preserved to us.</p>

<p class="indent">The element of divine wrath, common to monster
myths among barbarous peoples, again occurs in a Wyandot
version of the same tradition, taken down from a band of
Iroquois and Wyandots by Colonel G. Croghan, at the
Salt Licks in Kentucky in 1748, and given in Winterbotham's
"History of the United States," vol. iii., page 139.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
The head chief, says the writer, having been flattered
with presents of tobacco, paint, ammunition, etc., on
being asked about the large bones, related the ancient tradition
of his people as follows: "That the red man,
placed on this island by the Great Spirit, had been exceedingly
happy for ages, but foolish young people forgetting
his rules became ill-tempered and wicked, in consequence
of which the Great Spirit created the Great Buffalo, the
bones of which we now see before us. These made war
upon the human species alone, and destroyed all but a few,
who repented and promised the Great Spirit to live according
to his laws if he would restrain the devouring enemy;
whereupon he sent lightning and thunder, and destroyed
the whole race in this spot, two excepted, a male and
female, whom he shut up in yonder mountain, ready to
let loose again should occasion require."</p>

<p class="indent">David Cusic, the Tuscarora Indian, in his history
of the Iroquois, among other instances, speaks of the Big Quisquis,
<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
a terrible monster who invaded at an early time the
Indian settlements by Lake Ontario, and was at length
driven back by the warriors from several villages after a severe
engagement; and of the Big Elk, another great beast,
who invaded the towns with fury and was at length killed
in a great fight; and Elias Johnson, the Tuscarora chief,
in his "History of the Six Nations," speaks of another
monster that appeared at an early period in the history of
his people, "which they called Oyahguaharh, supposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
be some great mammoth who was furious against men,
and destroyed the lives of many Indian hunters, but who
was at length killed after a long and severe contest."</p>

<p class="indent">Another instance of a terrible monster desolating
the country of a certain tribe "with thunder and fire" appears
in a collection of Wyandot traditions published by
one William Walker, an Indian agent, in 1823; and
again the great beast appears in the song tradition of the
"Father of Oxen," from Canada, and in a monster tradition
from Louisiana, both spoken of by Fabri, a French
officer, in a letter to Buffon from America in 1748.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Reliquæ Aquitanicæ," published by Lartet
and Christy, page 60, quotes a letter from British America of
Robert Brown to Professor Rupert Jones, which speaks of a
tradition common to several widely separated tribes in the
Northwest, of lacustrine habitations built by their ancestors
to protect themselves against an animal who ravaged
the country a long time ago.</p>

<p class="indent">Hardly less remarkable in its description of the
animal than any of the others is, perhaps, the Great Elk tradition
as mentioned by Charlevoix in his "History of New France."</p>

<p class="indent">"There is current among these barbarians,"
says the author, "a pleasant-enough tradition of a Great Elk,
beside whom all others seem like ants. He has, they say,
legs so high that eight feet of snow does not embarrass
him, his skin is proof against all sorts of weapons, and he
has a sort of arm which comes out of his shoulder and
which he uses as we do ours."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Whatever we may have previously thought of
these legends, their evidence now combined with that of the
carving is irresistible. Nothing but the mammoth itself,
surviving into comparatively recent times and encountered
by the Indians, could suffice to account for the carving,
and we can no longer suppose that the size and unusual
appearance of the mammoth bones seen by the Indians
in Kentucky could alone have originated the traditions.</p>

<p class="indent">In the carving, we have the most interesting
mammoth picture in existence; not a mere drawing of the animal
itself, but a picture of primitive life, in which the mammoth
takes a conspicuous part in the actions and thoughts
of man,&mdash;a carving made with a bone or flint instrument
upon a tablet of slate at least four hundred years ago,&mdash;the
hairy elephant, drawn in unmistakable outline, and attacked
by human beings,&mdash;a battle-scene which thrills our
imagination, and the importance of which the ancient
draughtsman magnifies by the introduction of the symbols
of his religion, the sun, moon, and stars, and the lightning
alone powerful to overthrow the great enemy.</p>

<p class="indent">All is evidently the work of the Indian; so
would he rudely carve trees, the pine with its straight-spreading
arms, like a modern telegraph pole; his forest wigwam, a
simple triangle; the sun, with human face, and a halo;
and the moon, a crescent; the stars were small crosses,
and diverging lines were the rays of light that traversed
the sky from the great luminaries. Men were triangles
with their sides produced, and three dots in the head for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
eyes, nose, and mouth; here the minute forms standing
their ground before the great beast, are warriors, with
feathers in their hair, and bows and lances in their hands.
The chief figure, the great buffalo, or the great elk of
Charlevoix, armed with a proboscis, as the Indians may
well have named the mammoth, is assailed, as in the Jefferson
tradition, by lightning.</p>

<p class="indent">Between such a monster, however inoffensive
in its habits, and the Indian hunter, there could be no peace;
his size and terrific appearance were enough for the
superstitious fancy of the red man, and as he browses
harmlessly near the village he is attacked; then his rage
transforms him into the fierce enemy and destroyer of
mankind remembered in the traditions. As naively represented
in the carving, he tramples men to a pulp under his
feet with the ungovernable fury of a modern elephant,
and overturns whole villages of fragile wigwams, while his
anger perhaps vents itself in loud bellowings; arrows and
spears only annoy him; he must be destroyed by the
lightnings of the Great Spirit to whom the medicine men
pray for help.</p>

<p class="indent">A remarkable story, alleged in support of the
coëxistence of the Indian, and the mammoth's great contemporary
the mastodon, regarded by most scientists with distrust,
though defended by some, was that of Dr. Albert Koch,
a collector of curiosities, who in 1839 disinterred the
skeleton of a mastodon in a clay bed near the Bourboise
River, Gasconade County, Missouri. Associated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the bones Koch claimed to have discovered, in the presence
of a number of witnesses, a layer of wood-ashes,
numerous fragments of rock, "some arrow-heads, a stone
spear-point, and several stone axes," evidencing he
claimed, that the huge animal had met its untimely end
at the hands of savages, who, armed with rude weapons
of stone and boulders brought from the bed of the neighboring
river, had attacked it, while helplessly mired in
the soft clay, and finally effected its destruction by fire.</p>

<p class="indent">Koch also published with his statement and in
connection with another skeleton, that of the <i>Mastodon giganteus</i>
discovered by him in Benton County, Missouri, a tradition
of the Osage Indians, in whose former territory the bones
were found, and which he says led him to the discovery.
It states, says Koch, "that there was a time when the
Indians paddled their canoes over the now extensive
prairies of Missouri and encamped or hunted on the bluffs.
That at a certain period many large and monstrous animals
came from the eastward along and up the Mississippi and
Missouri rivers, upon which the animals that had previously
occupied the country became very angry, and at
last so enraged and infuriated by reason of these intrusions,
that the red man durst not venture out to hunt any more,
and was consequently reduced to great distress. At this
time a large number of these huge monsters assembled
here, when a terrible battle ensued, in which many on both
sides were killed, and the remnant resumed their march
toward the setting sun. Near the bluffs which are at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
present known by the name of the Rocky Ridge one of
the greatest of these battles was fought. Immediately
after the battle the Indians gathered together many of the
slaughtered animals and offered them up on the spot as a
burnt sacrifice to the Great Spirit. The remainder were
buried by the Great Spirit himself, in the Pomme de Terre
River, which from this time took the name of the Big-Bone
River, as well as the Osage, of which the Pomme de
Terre is a branch. From this time the Indians brought
their yearly sacrifice to this place, and offered it up to the
Great Spirit, as a thank-offering for their great deliverance,
and more latterly, they have offered their sacrifice on the
table rock above mentioned (a curious rock near the spot
of the discovery), which was held in great veneration and
considered holy ground."</p>

<p class="indent">There is considerable variety of opinion of late,
and especially among persons familiar with the Indians, as to
the value of the information furnished by their traditions;
and certainly among Indians to-day the separation of
their pre-Columbian from their later traditions, and their
traditions proper from the extravagant relations so readily
dealt forth by them extempore, is no easy matter. Much
stress is laid on the absence of a tradition of De Soto; yet,
as Schoolcraft remarks, the Delawares and Mohicans had
in his time one of Hudson, the Chippeways of Cartier, and
the Iroquois one of a wreck on a sea-coast, and the extinction
of an infant colony, probably Jamestown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Interest in the American elephant has of late been
considerably increased by the appearance of several supposed
representations of the animal among the relics of our
aborigines, drawings of which, and of the so-called elephant
trunks, and head-dresses from the architecture of
Mexico and Central America, are given in the following pages.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>Not one of these outlines is unmistakable, and all lack
the characteristic tusks of the mammoth.</p>

</div>
<p class="f120 space-below"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Elephant Pipe (Louisa Co., Iowa).
</p>

<p class="indent">Figures 2 and 3, the now famous "elephant pipes,"
the authenticity of which is doubted, however, in the last report
of the Bureau of Ethnology, came to light in Louisa
County, Iowa. The former, discovered in 1872 or 1873,
was found, it is said, on the surface by a farmer while
planting corn; and the latter, more interesting from the
scratches upon it evidently intended to represent hair, was
taken from a mound near an old bed of the Mississippi
by the Rev. Dr. Blumer and others on March 2, 1880.
The material of the two pipes, which apparently have
been much greased and smoked, is the same&mdash;a light-colored
sandstone.</p>

<p class="indent">The next of the elephant <i>documents</i> is the
so-called elephant mound of Grant County, Wisconsin, (fig. 4). It
was described by Mr. Jared Warner, of Patch Grove,
Wisconsin, on page 416 of the "Smithsonian Report for
1872," when public attention was first generally called to
it. The effigy, 135 feet long, 60 feet broad, and but
5 feet high, is situated on the east bank of the Mississippi,
just below the mouth of the Wisconsin, and, says
Mr. Warner, has been known in the neighborhood of
Patch Grove for twenty-five years as the "elephant
mound." Like the elephant pipes, however, it lacks the
characteristic tusks, and sceptics claim that its original
shape has been too much modified by many years of cultivation
to render judgments concerning it admissible.

&mdash;Elephant Mound (Grant County, Wisconsin).</p>

<p class="indent">But to return to the carving, a somewhat novel
feature in it, and one which has been objected to as casting a
doubt upon its authenticity, is the spear between the two
upright human figures on the right. Large flint spear-points,
so-called, are found abundantly in the Eastern
States, and within the last hundred years instances of the
use of the spear by the Indians in hunting and fishing are
common; no one doubts, as we learn, for instance, in Tanner's
narrative, that the Indians speared salmon in the
Eastern rivers, or, as Catlin shows, used steel-pointed
lances in their Western buffalo hunts. Yet the early
writers, in their descriptions of aboriginal implements, have
been supposed to make no mention of the spear, and
there has been some controversy among archæologists as
to whether it can be classed among Indian prehistoric
weapons of warfare or the chase.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Abbott, who, in his "Prehistoric Industry,"
has given a wood-cut of the curious egg-shaped stone found at
Lake Winnipissiogee, and upon which there are several
carvings of spears, quotes in the same work, by way of the
nearest approach to an allusion to the spear among the
early writers, a description from Josselyn of an elk-hunt
among the early Massachusetts Indians, in which the
writer describes a lance made of a staff a yard and a half
long and pointed with fish-bone. But a passage in Bernal
Diaz del Castillo ("Historia verdadera de la Conquista de
la nueva Espana," Madrid, 1638), kindly pointed out to
the writer by Dr. Rau, seems to furnish conclusive evidence
on the subject. Bernal Diaz, among several instances
in his works, speaks (chapter vi.) of an attack
upon the Spaniards in Florida by Indians "armed with
immense-sized bows, sharp arrows, and spears, among
which some were shaped like swords" ("y lanzas y unas
ā manera de espadas").</p>

<p class="indent">Furthermore there is fig. 5 (plate xiv. from De
Bry's "Brevis Narratio," published in Latin in Frankfort-on-the-Main
in 1591), representing Indians holding spears,
for which likewise the writer is indebted to Dr. Rau. It
was drawn from life by one Jacques Le Moyne, a French
artist, in 1564. He had come to Florida with the French
Admiral Laudonnière, and having been left by the expedition
for some months at a fort upon the St. John's
River, frequently made sketching expeditions among the
neighboring tribes. Many similar drawings by him of
warriors armed with spears are to be found among the
numerous illustrations in De Bry.

<p class="indent">Figures 6 and 7, reduced from Catherwood's
"Atlas" to Stephens' "Yucatan," are fair specimens of the
remarkable architectural ornaments from Central America
known as elephant trunks, and which, placed between two
eyes and a mouth-like cavity, seem at first, as Waldeck
and other travellers have remarked, to bear a striking
resemblance to the trunk of a proboscidean.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Figure 6 is from the gateway of the great
Teocallis at Uxmal, and 7 from that of the Casa de las Monjos
at Uxmal; as in the case of all the other "elephant trunks,"
however, they offer no suggestion of the prominent tusks
of the American elephant, and, as Dr. F. W. Putnam
maintains, should perhaps be looked upon as grotesque
representations of the human race, of which the so-called
trunk forms the nose.</p>

not accidental resemblance of the priest's head-dress to
the Hindoo Ganesa, or elephant-headed god of wisdom.
It seems hardly possible to suppose that a tapir's snout
could have suggested the trunk in the head-dress, and we
are almost left to infer either that the people of Atzlan
had received some notice of the elephant from Asia, or
that their traditions reached back to the time of the
American elephant."

from the Collection of M. Lartet.</p>

<p class="indent">It is interesting to compare the Lenape Stone
with the mammoth carvings of the cave-men of Europe, of which
we here give the series. None of these outlines equal the
Lenape drawing in realistic spirit except, perhaps (fig. 10)
the most remarkable of them all, the celebrated La Madeleine
carving. It is engraved upon mammoth ivory and
was discovered in 1864 in the cave of La Madeleine, Perigord,
France, by M. Louis Lartet. It was broken into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
five fragments, and like the carving on the Lenape Stone,
which it singularly resembles in general position, and in
the indecisive drawing of the back and tail, unmistakably
represents the mammoth. The mammoth scratching his
side (fig. 11), and the very indistinct head (fig. 12), carved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
on opposite sides of a bone plate, are from the Edouard
Lartet collection. M. Louis Lartet, brother of the former,
in his description of the drawings in the "Matériaux pour
l'histoire primitive de l'homme," vol. ix., p. 33, thinks that
"the primitive artist to whom these rude but sufficiently
faithful representations are due, and who changed his
mind several times when sketching, had, without doubt,
the living model before his eyes, and was disturbed in his
work by the movements of the animal."</p>

discovered in the rock shelter of Bruniquel (Tarne et

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
muzzle has been greatly exaggerated and the shape of the trunk
and position of the tusks have been considerably departed from.</p>

<p class="indent">The least interesting specimen perhaps in
the French collection is (fig. 14) the very indistinct elephant's
head, minus the tusks, discovered by the Marquis
de Vibraye in the cave of Laugerie Basse,
Dordogne, France. Another so-called prehistoric
representation of the mammoth,
though resembling that animal only in the
trunk-like prolongation of its muzzle, is (fig.

Siberia. The writer of the description in
the "Matériaux," vol. iv., p. 197, prefers
to consider it a fantastic cat, tiger, or lion.

<p class="indent">Let us picture to ourselves, as it occurred in
ancient times, and when his customs and traditions were as yet
uncontaminated by civilization, one of the great religious
feasts of the Indian&mdash;a dance, in honor, perhaps, of the
sun, or pipe of peace, or of the green corn.</p>

<p class="indent">A wildly picturesque scene rises before us, as we
read the descriptions of writers who have witnessed these ceremonies
in later days; such a scene, as&mdash;in the language
of Catlin: "not all the years allotted to mortal man could
in the least deface or obliterate from the memory."</p>

<p class="indent">The tribe is assembled in the Indian village, or
upon a bare hill-top, or perhaps in a lonely spot in the forest;
a great bonfire burns in their midst, around which many
mysterious rites have been performed. The rain perhaps
was to be called down from heaven, sickness averted,
evil spirits to be exorcised and driven away, or the deer or
moose to be led in a state of charmed fatuity into the
midst of the camp. With wild noises and gestures the warriors
have danced around the fire, waving corn-stalks, or
fiercely brandishing their weapons of war; the odor of
burning tobacco or roasting dog's flesh fills the air, and
the forest re-echoes with the cawings of the crow, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
"gobble" of the wild turkey, or the growl of the bear,
exactly imitated by the dancers. With a truthfulness
born of their intense sympathy for nature, the moving
figures mimic the spring of the panther or wild-cat, the
start of the deer, and the sinuous motion of the snake.</p>

<p class="indent">At length a figure, half man half animal,
approaches&mdash;the prophet or medicine-man. Nothing can be more
strange than his appearance; his dress is hung with the skins of
snakes, frogs, and bats, and adorned with the beaks, tails,
and toes of birds, and the hoofs of the deer and antelope,&mdash;a
diabolical embodiment of animal monstrosity.</p>

<p class="indent">All is now quiet, and from his medicine bag, made
of the skin of the raccoon, polecat, or bat, beautifully decorated,
and lined with moss and fine grass, he produces a
scroll of birch bark, a tablet of wood, or a stone, engraved
with mystic characters. Holding the tablet in his hands, as
his eye falls upon the carved devices a low sound, rising into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
a song or chant, now only interrupted by the crackling of
the fire, issues from under the hideous bear's-mask which
hides his head. Each picture suggests to his mind some
event of the far past, carefully treasured in the traditional
lore of his tribe.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
His song, rising and falling in strange
inflections, and preserving a sort of rhythm, now tells of
the creation of the world, a deluge, the origin of his
people, and their primitive struggles with the forces
of nature; now images of primeval giants and demi-gods
rise before the minds of the assembled tribe, his
hearers, of Manabozho the great hare, of Tarentya-wagon
holder of the heavens, of Hiawatha, and Nanabush,
and of "Stonish Giants," and "Flying Heads"; now
he tells of the passage of great waters and mountains, of
treeless plains, and forests, now of long wars with human
enemies, and of the final coming of the whites. The
squatting figures listen in motionless silence, as the song
proceeds through its many verses, each the theme of a
particular event. At last it ceases, and the pictured scroll
or tablet, formula of its spell, restored to its place in the
medicine pouch, remains hidden from the eyes of the tribe
until its reappearance upon some similar occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">Such is the song-chronicle of the Indian's
history; and such songs are known to have been carefully preserved
and sung by many if not all of the Eastern tribes.</p>

<p class="indent">Such was the national song-legend of the Creeks
and Choctaws, narrating in considerable detail their traditional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
origin and early migration from the West. It was
read to the English by the Creek chief, Chekillè, at Savannah,
in 1775, "and was written in red and black characters
on the skin of a young buffalo." This pictured skin, with
an English translation, was sent to London, and there, in
a frame in the Georgia office, at Westminister, was kept
for many years as a curiosity; it was finally lost, but the
translation has been recently brought to light by Dr.
D. G. Brinton, of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="indent">Such, too, was the national song of the Cherokees,
sung by them at their annual green-corn dance. Portions of it
which tell of an early migration from the headwaters
of the Monongahela, and of the great mound at Grave
Creek which the Cherokees claim to have built, are given
by Haywood in his "History of Tennessee." They were
related to the author from memory by an old Indian
trader who had heard the song. Mr. Chamberlain, at
present missionary among the Cherokees, states that
Guess or Sequoyah, a half-breed Cherokee, since dead, had
invented the Cherokee alphabet of eighty-two letters,
for the express purpose of perpetuating this chronicle
of his nation, and had recorded it in the new characters,
but these interesting manuscripts, which after his
death were unfortunately mislaid, have thus far escaped discovery.</p>

<p class="indent">The Blackfeet, too, have a singular historical
song sung on stated occasions; and the Shawnees, now situated in
the northeast corner of the Indian territory, have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
national legend, described in one of the late Indian
reports as a "weird song sung in a rising melancholy
strain"; it is sung at one of their great annual feasts, but
as yet the double-barrelled shotgun or the "handsomest
blanket in Philadelphia," offered by Dr. Brinton for a
translation, have not served to break the reserve of the
Indians familiar with the particular dialect in which it
is sung, and who say that its revelation would bring
misfortune upon the tribe.</p>

<p class="indent">The historical records of the Ojibways, says
Ka-ge-ga-gah-bowh, or George Copway, their native historian,
were written in Indian hieroglyphics upon "slate-rock,
copper, lead, and the bark of birch trees," and kept
in three secret underground depositories near the headwaters
of Lake Superior, where, being disinterred and
examined every fifteen years by a committee of chiefs, the
dimmed and decaying pictographs were replaced by facsimiles.</p>

<p class="indent">It seems highly probable, in fact, that the solemn
songs above, as well as most of the important historical narratives
of the Indian tribes, have been repeatedly and
variously recorded in eye-catching pictures of men, animals,
and natural objects, intended to refresh or jog the
memory of the singer or speaker, in his lengthy recitations
to the assembled tribe. And such a pictured song-chart,
or reference-table we may perhaps consider the
carving on the reverse of the Lenape stone (fig. 16), which,
should it be, as we have supposed, a production of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Lenni Lenape, would not unnaturally refer to the well-known
historical legend of that ancient people.</p>

</div>
<p class="f120 space-below"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span></p>

<p class="indent">This tradition of the Delawares, more interesting
and suggestive probably than any of these long-overlooked
records of ancient North America, has once at least, been
recorded by Indians in pictographic symbols; fortunately
it has been preserved to us in full, and we can compare
it with the carving on the reverse of the Lenape stone
(fig. 16), which we may suppose suggested to
the mind of the Indian singer versed in the art of picture-writing
some at least of the events remembered in his tradition.</p>

<p class="indent">Two versions of this wonderful Indian chronicle
have been rescued from oblivion. The first, far less complete
than the other, was collected from the Indians themselves
by the Moravian missionary Heckewelder, about
1800. It reads as follows: "The Lenni Lenape (according
to the traditions handed down to them by their
ancestors) resided many hundred years ago in a very
distant country, in the western part of the American
continent. For some reason which I do not find accounted
for, they determined on migrating to the eastward,
and accordingly set out together in a body. After
a very long journey, and many nights' encampments by
the way, they at length arrived at the Namaesi Sipu, or
River of Fish (from <i>namaes</i>, a fish, and <i>sipu</i>, a river)."</p>

<p class="indent">One of the first figures that catches our eye on
looking at the carvings is the unmistakable outline of a fish,
(<i>a</i>), just beneath the waving lines; (<i>b</i>) representing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
water at the left of the stone. The tradition goes on to say
that at this river the Delawares "fell in with the Mengwe
(Iroquois, or five nations), who had likewise emigrated
from a distant country, and had struck upon this river
somewhat higher up. Their object was the same with
that of the Delawares; they were proceeding on to the
eastward until they should find a country that pleased
them. The spies which the Lenape had sent forward
for the purpose of reconnoitring, had long before their
arrival discovered that the country east of the Mississippi
was inhabited by a very powerful nation, who had many
large towns built on the great rivers flowing through their
land. Those people (as I was told) called themselves
Talligeu or Talligewi. Colonel John Gibson, however, a
gentleman who has a thorough knowledge of the Indians,
and speaks several of their languages, is of opinion that
they were not called Talligewi, but Alligewi, and it would
seem that he is right, from the traces of their name,
which still remain in the country, the Allegheny river and
mountains having indubitably been named after them.
The Delawares still call the former Alligéwi Sipu, the
River of the Alligewi."</p>

<p class="indent">"Many wonderful things are told of this famous
people. They are said to have been remarkably tall and stout, and
there is a tradition that there were giants among them,
people of a much larger size than the tallest of the
Lenape. It is related that they had built to themselves
regular fortifications or intrenchments, from whence they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
would sally out, but were generally repulsed.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
* * * When the Lenape arrived on the banks of the Mississippi,
they sent a message to the Alligewi to request
permission to settle themselves in their neighborhood.
This was refused them, but they obtained leave to pass
through the country and seek a settlement farther to the eastward."</p>

<p class="indent">This agreement, that the Lenape should cross
in peace, might have been symbolized in the Muzzinabiks (rock
writings) and historical song records of any tribe, by the
figure of the pipe <a href="#Page_38">(<i>c</i>)</a> on the left of the
stone, just above the water, and opposite the fish.</p>

<p class="indent">"They accordingly began to cross the Namaesi
Sipu," continues the account, "when the Alligewi, seeing that
their numbers were so very great, and in fact they consisted
of many thousands, made a furious attack on those
who had crossed, threatening them all with destruction if
they dared to persist in coming over to their side of the
river. Fired at the treachery of these people, and the
great loss of men they had sustained, and besides, not
being prepared for a conflict, the Lenape consulted on
what was to be done&mdash;whether to retreat in the best
manner they could, or try their strength, and let the
enemy see they were not cowards, but men, and too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
highminded to suffer themselves to be driven off before they
had made a trial of their strength, and were convinced
that the enemy was too powerful for them. The Mengwe,
who had hitherto been satisfied with being spectators
from a distance, offered to join them on condition that,
after conquering the country, they should be entitled to
share it with them. Their proposal was accepted, and the
resolution was taken by the two nations to conquer or die.
Having thus united their forces, the Lenape and Mengwe
declared war against the Alligewi, and great battles were
fought, in which many warriors fell on both sides."</p>

<p class="indent">This ancient alliance may have been symbolized
to the mind of the Delaware by the figures of the hawk <a href="#Page_38">(<i>e</i>)</a>,
beneath which is seen (<i>f</i>) perhaps a wampum belt, and
of the turtle (<i>d</i>) in the central part of the stone, and
set in divisions formed by one intersecting and four diverging
lines. Devices of the "great Thunder-bird, whose eyes
were fire and glance lightning, and the motion of whose
wings filled the air with thunder," and of the "great
turtle, upon whose back the mother of the human race
had been received from heaven," were common in the
mystic songs of the medas or priests, and their particular
significations in these incantations might have been almost
endless when we consider that to the initiated <i>Meda</i> or
<i>Josakeed</i> (prophet) the same sign calls up quite different
ideas, as the theme of the writer varies from war to love,
or from the chase to medicine, or prophecy. If, however,
we refer the subject of the carving to history, the hawk
and turtle may well be viewed as the tokens or heraldic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
badges of the chief actors in the story<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
(the Lenape and Mengwe).</p>

<p class="indent">As clan badges, both symbols were in common
use among most of the Indian tribes. The turtle clan, says
Heckewelder, was the governing family in any nation, and
among the Delawares claimed an ascendency over the
wolf and turkey families on account of its superior antiquity
and relationship to "the great turtle, the Atlas of
their mythology, who bore the great island&mdash;the earth&mdash;upon
its back."</p>

<p class="indent">The hawk totem, which of course the Delawares
might have applied to any people they chose, irrespective
of its real emblem, occurred among the Hurons, and in
both the Seneca and Cayuga tribes of the Iroquois confederacy;
also among the Ojibways, Pottowatamies, Miamis,
Abenakis, Sacs, and Foxes, and in many other tribes.</p>

<p class="indent">The account goes on to say that "the enemy fortified
their large towns and erected fortifications, especially on
large rivers and near lakes, where they were successively
attacked and sometimes stormed by the allies. An engagement
took place, in which hundreds fell, who were
afterwards buried in holes or laid together in heaps and
covered over with earth. No quarter was given, so that
the Alligewi, at last, finding that their destruction was
inevitable if they persisted in their obstinacy, abandoned
the country to the conquerors and fled down the Mississippi
River, from whence they never returned. The war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
which was carried on by this nation lasted many years,
during which the Lenape lost a great number of their
warriors, while the Mengwe would always hang back in
the rear, leaving them to face the enemy."</p>

<p class="indent">In this description of a superior race of
Indians, conquered after a most desperate resistance, and whose
memory still survives in the great mountain chain to
which they have given a name, we find a key to the often-spoken-of
mystery of the mound-builders and their sudden disappearance.</p>

<p class="indent">The story of their long death-struggle and final
overthrow by a horde of savage invaders, as here given in the
formal style of Heckewelder, seems somewhat colored by
his well-known partiality for the Delawares. It is confirmed,
as we shall see, by the evidence of other Indian traditions
and the study of their language, which seems to
show that this people,&mdash;the Alligewi or mound-builders&mdash;fleeing
down the Mississippi, were received and adopted
by the Choctaws and Cherokees, themselves in comparatively
recent times a mound-building people, and who
thus have become in part their descendants.</p>

<p class="indent">A suggestion of these long and bloody wars, in
which the Lenape did most of the fighting, may be seen in the
figure of the tomahawk <a href="#Page_38">(<i>g</i>)</a> just below the turtle,<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>
and of the mound-builders themselves perhaps, in the singular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
group of figures above the water on the left, <i>i. e.</i>, the outline
of a mountain or mound on which a series of numerical
marks are faintly seen, a tablet inscribed with ten dots,
two diagonally intersecting lines, and five parallel marks or points.</p>

<p class="indent">"In the end," continues the account, "the conquerors
divided the country between themselves," as the wigwams
<a href="#Page_38">(<i>h</i> and <i>i</i>)</a> above each totem might denote.
"The Mengwe made choice of the lands in the vicinity of the
great lakes" and on their tributary streams, again suggested,
perhaps, by the snow-shoe (<i>j</i>) "and the Lenape
took possession of the country to the south. For a long
period of time&mdash;some say many hundred years&mdash;the two
nations resided peacefully in this country and increased
very fast. Some of their most enterprising huntsmen
and warriors crossed the great swamps, and falling on
streams running to the eastward, followed them down to
the great Bay River (Susquehannah), and thence into the
bay itself, which we call Chesapeak." As they pursued
their travels, partly by land and partly by water, in this
primitive reconnaissance of the great wilderness now our
homes, journeying sometimes near and at other times on
the "great salt-water lake" (the sea), they finally discovered
the river which we call the Delaware.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thence exploring still eastward," continues the
account, "they discovered the Scheyichbi country, now named New
Jersey, and at length arrived at another great stream&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
which we call the Hudson or North River. Satisfied
with what they had seen, they (or some of them), after a
long absence, returned to their nation and reported the
discoveries they had made. They described the country
they had discovered as abounding in game and various
kinds of fruits, and the rivers and bays with fish, tortoises,
etc., together with abundance of water-fowl, and no enemy
to be dreaded. They considered the event as a fortunate
one for them, and concluding this to be the country destined
for them by the Great Spirit, they began to emigrate
thither, as yet but in small bodies, so as not to be straitened
for want of provisions by the way, some even laying
by for a whole year. At last they settled on the four
great rivers (which we call Delaware, Hudson, Susquehanna,
and Potomac), making the Delaware, to which
they gave the name of '<i>Lenapewihittuck</i>,' (the river or
stream of the Lenape), the centre of their possessions."</p>

<p class="indent">Here the ancient portion of the chronicle and
its parallelism with the figures on the stone seems to end, the
remainder being devoted to long wars with the Mengwe,
relations with the whites, and the more modern events of
the history of the tribe in the east.</p>

<p class="indent">The other figures upon the stone&mdash;the star <a href="#Page_38">(<i>k</i>)</a>,
the calumet (<i>l</i>), the deer (<i>m</i>), the curve crossed by three
oblique lines (<i>n</i>), probably a war canoe, and the fish-like
figure (<i>o</i>) at the end of the stone&mdash;are hardly suggested by
the narrative, yet may refer to further details of the passage
of the Alleghenies, and the exploration and settlement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of the country to the east, along the great rivers and by the sea-coast.</p>

<p class="indent">Far more interesting than Heckewelder's account,
is a full version of the great national song of the Lenape as
they sung it in their own language, with an English translation,
and with all the pictographic devices used to jog
the memory of the singer. He may well have needed
them, as the whole song consists of two hundred and two
verses. It was first published in 1836 by the eccentric
French-American philosopher, Rafinesque, in an extravagant
work by him entitled "The American Nations," and
is known as the Wallum Olum (literally, painted sticks),
or pictographic traditions of the Lenni Lenape. It contains
the Delaware account of the creation, a deluge, the
early migrations and entire history of the tribe, and one
hundred and eighty-four mnemonic symbols painted upon
tablets of wood. "It was obtained" says Rafinesque,
"about 1822,&mdash;the symbols from a Dr. Ward of Indiana,
who had received them as a reward for a medical cure
from the Delawares, at Wahapani or White River, in 1820,
and the verses from another individual."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. E. G. Squier, who considered the internal
evidence furnished by the songs sufficiently strong to settle
their authenticity, submitted the manuscript copy of the songs
and pictographs in the hand of Rafinesque, who it appears
had never owned the original "painted sticks," to George
Copway, the Chippewa chief, who unhesitatingly, he says,
pronounced it authentic. This manuscript, together with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the pictographs, of which Rafinesque had published none,
and Squier but forty, was considered hopelessly lost until
its fortunate discovery a few weeks ago by Dr. Brinton, by
whom it will shortly be published with a new translation.</p>

<p class="indent">Passing over its account of the creation and
deluge, the narrative goes on to describe the passage by the Lenape
of a large body of water on the ice (Behring's Straits,
says Rafinesque), and their settlement at a place called
<i>Shinaki</i>, or the "Land of Firs."</p>

<p class="indent">After many generations of chiefs, continues the
fourth song, during which time they were continually engaged in
wars with "<i>Snakes</i>" (enemies), they wander from the fir
land to the south and east, pass over a hollow mountain
<i>Oligonunk</i> (Oregon, according to Rafinesque), and at last
"find food" at "<i>Shililaking</i>, the plains of the Buffalo Land."
Here they tarry and build towns and raise corn on the
great meadows of the <i>Wisawana</i> (Yellow River). But
after many wars with "<i>Snakes</i>," "northern enemies," and
"father snakes," of which we can see a suggestion in the
eel-like form (<i>p</i>) on the stone, they again resume their
migration towards the "sun-rising," and finally reach the
shores of the Messussipu,<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>
or Great River, "which divides the land."
The accompanying pictograph for verse 49,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
descriptive of the Great River, quite unlike the figure upon
the stone, is here given from the original drawing by
Rafinesque, kindly furnished the writer by Dr. Brinton
(fig. 17). The narrative, of which we give the English
translation by Rafinesque, omitting the Delaware version,
continues in the original as follows:</p>

<div class="figright">
  <img src="images/fig-17.jpg" alt="_" width="150" height="148" />
<p class="f90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="blockquot">49. The Great River (<i>Messussipu</i>) divided the land, and being
tired, they tarried there.</p>

<p class="blockquot">50. <i>Yagawanend</i> (Hut-maker) was next <i>sakima</i>,
and then the <i>Tallegwi</i> were found possessing the east.</p>

<p class="blockquot">51. Followed <i>Chitanitis</i> (Strong-friend), who longed for the
rich east-land.</p>

<p class="blockquot">52. Some went to the east, but the <i>Tallegwi</i> killed a portion.</p>

<p class="blockquot">53. Then all of one mind exclaimed: War, war!</p>

<p class="blockquot">54. The <i>Talamatan</i> (not of themselves) and the <i>Nitilowan</i>
all go united (to the war).</p>

<p class="blockquot">55. <i>Kinehepend</i> (Sharp-looking) was their leader, and they
went over the river.</p>

<p class="blockquot">56. And they took all that was there, and despoiled and slew
the <i>Tallegwi</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">57. <i>Piniokhasuwi</i> (Stirring-about) was next chief, and then
the Tallegwi were much too strong.</p>

<p class="blockquot">58. <i>Teuchekensit</i> (Open-path) followed, and many towns were
given up to him.</p>

<p class="blockquot">59. <i>Paganchihilla</i> was chief, and the
<i>Tallegwi</i> all went southward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">60. <i>Hattanwulaton</i> (the Possessor) was <i>sakima</i>,
and all the people were pleased.</p>

<p class="blockquot">61. South of the lakes they settled their council-fire,
and north of the lakes were their friends the <i>Talamatan</i> (Hurons?).</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing could be more interesting to the lover
of American archæology than a study of this song&mdash;with the
single exception perhaps of the Lenape stone, the most
remarkable Indian document in existence. The latter part
of the story here given, is even less suggestive than
the preceding portions, which we have been obliged to omit.</p>

<p class="indent">The generations of chiefs, which it recites
in order, seem to include thousands of years, and as we read
its account of a creation and a deluge, of the passage of a
great water upon the ice, and an arrival at a "Land of
Firs," we almost pardon the extravagant speculations of
Rafinesque, to which it gave rise.</p>

<p class="indent">Both versions of the account tell the same
story, yet there is one striking difference between them. In
the Heckewelder version the allies of the Lenape are spoken
of as "Mengwi" (Iroquois, <i>Mingoes</i>); in the Wallum
Olum as "Talamatan" (Hurons, called Delamattenos by
the Delawares); but the variance is reconciled when we consider
that in ancient times, as their language and traditions
prove, the Hurons and Iroquois were one closely allied
nation, constituting one family or linguistic stock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">We may doubt, however, whether the great river
crossed in the migration&mdash;"<i>Namaesi Sipu</i>" (Fish River)
in Heckewelder, and "<i>Messussipu</i>" in the Wallum Olum&mdash;referred
to the Mississippi.</p>

<p class="indent">The Huron-Iroquois will tell us, when questioned,
that at an early period, and while the families were still united,
his people, coming originally from the northeast of Canada,
migrated to the southward, and had not come from
the west across the Mississippi; he too has traditions of
crossing a river and attacking a race of mound-builders,
but the river of his account was crossed to the southward,
and lay on the north of the mound-builders' country.
The Iroquois tradition is given in a famous passage, supposed
to refer to the mound-builders, in the account of
David Cusic, a native Iroquois, of the Tuscarora clan,
who wrote a history of his tribe. We give it here in the
original, uncorrected form, as published by Schoolcraft.</p>

<p class="indent">Referring to an early age of monsters, demi-gods,
giants, and horned serpents, when the Hurons and Iroquois were
as yet but one people, and they and other tribes, "the
northern nations," possessed the banks of the great lakes,
"where there were plenty of beavers," but "where the
hunters were often opposed by the big <i>Snakes</i>," Cusic goes
on to say that "on one occasion the northern nations
formed a confederacy, and seated a great council-fire on
the river St. Lawrence. Perhaps about 2,200 years before
the Columbus discovered the America, the northern
nations appointed a prince, and immediately repaired to
the south and visited the Great Emperor, who resided at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the Golden City, a capital of the vast Empire. After a
time the Emperor built many forts throughout his dominions,
and almost penetrated the Lake Erie. This
produced an excitement; the people on the north felt
that they would soon be deprived of the country on the
south side of the great lakes. They determined to defend
their country against any infringement of foreign people;
long, bloody wars ensued, which lasted about one hundred
years. The people of the north were too skilful in
the use of bows and arrows, and could endure hardships
which proved fatal to a foreign people; at last the northern
nations gained the conquest, and all the towns and
forts were totally destroyed, and left them in the heap of ruins."</p>

<p class="indent">It has been supposed that the upper St. Lawrence
or Detroit River, streams noticed by the Indians as abounding
in fish, was the "Fish River" of the Heckewelder
tradition. Here, as we have seen according to information
collected from the Lenni Lenape, desperate battles
had taken place with the Allegwi, hundreds of whom
were slain and buried under mounds in that vicinity.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Other considerations, too, induce us to suppose
that the Lenape and Huron-Iroquois invasion came from the
northward and not from the west. If we study the shape
and position of the mounds themselves along the southern
shore of the great lakes, we find that they present often the
appearance of fortifications erected against the advance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of an enemy from the north, and suddenly abandoned
after a long struggle. Also the scattered implements and
half-removed blocks of ore found in the prehistoric
copper mines on the south shore of Lake Superior,
seemed to indicate their hasty desertion by the miners
upon the sudden inroad of an enemy from that direction.</p>

<p class="indent">Again, the works of the mound-builders, though
at some points insignificant and hardly perceptible, extend
considerably west of the Mississippi, and probably would
have been encountered by the advancing Lenape before
reaching that river, and had it been the stream meant it
would not have been spoken of as the boundary of the
mound-builders' empire.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>

<p class="indent">The Wallum Olum, however, with its hieroglyphics,
does not end with the brief extract given. Song five, consisting
of fifty-eight verses, recounts the details of the occupation
by the conquerors of the Ohio valley, and long wars with
enemies denominated "<i>Father Snakes</i>," "<i>Stone Snakes</i>," and
"<i>North Snakes</i>," whose pictograph in the original manuscript
is here given (fig. 18). They pass the Alleghenies, and
exploring the Chesapeake Bay and great
rivers of "the large and long east land,"
finally establish themselves on the Delaware,
making "<i>Maskekitong</i>," the rapids at
Trenton, the centre of their dominions.
We have now reached the time of the coming of the
whites, and the last verses of the song speak in brief
simplicity of a people who came from somewhere, "and
that which was white" (ships) "coming from the East Sea."</p>

<p class="indent">There is still another song&mdash;the sixth&mdash;continuing
the chronicle and recounting the melancholy story of the
Lenape's contact with the whites, and final westward
journey to Ohio, where the records were obtained. A narrative
of sufferings and hard wrongs, whose recital by the
Indian had caused Heckewelder, as he said, "to feel
ashamed that he was a white man."</p>

<p class="indent">The symbols appended to the songs, and among
which the forms of the rectangle and circle frequently occur,
end with the fifth song; they appear very arbitrary, and it is
certainly disappointing to find that they bear no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
resemblance to the carvings upon the Lenape stone, likewise, as
we have supposed, productions of the Lenni Lenape and
dealing with the same subject. Yet we need not be surprised
when we consider the varied and often arbitrary
methods of Indian picture-writing.</p>

<p class="indent">In comparing the carvings on the reverse of the
Lenape stone with the Lenape and Huron-Iroquois traditions of
their early migration and struggle with the mound-builders,
we have spoken only of probabilities. Possibly
these carvings may refer to the incantations of the
prophets and doctors, to songs for "medicine hunting,"
or charms against evil spirits, and not to the history of
the tribe, as recounted in the Wallum Olum and the
narratives of Heckewelder and Cusic. Possibly, too, the
modern Indians who have seen the carvings may have
entirely mistaken their subject, as similar signs are used
in quite different kinds of their picture-writing. Yet if
we view the chief feature of the Lenape stone&mdash;the
mammoth picture&mdash;as an example of muzzinabik or historical
picture-writing, an attempt to explain the carvings
on the reverse of the stone as specimens of the same
class of writings does not seem extravagant. Viewed in
the light of these legends, and compared with the fragments
of ancient Indian history which chance has preserved
to us, the carvings upon the Lenape stone vividly
impress upon our minds the reality of that dark period of
our continent's past, antecedent to the first coming of the
white man, separated from us by but a few centuries, yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
where the boundary line between history and geology
becomes indistinct, when for hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of years the Indian lived alone on the "great island,"
and while those deep-rooted peculiarities of his character,
which civilization has failed to eradicate, were slowly
growing out of his wilderness life.</p>

<p class="indent">The ancient presence of the Lenape is often
remembered in the heart of his former dominions. Along the
shores of the beautiful river, whose transatlantic name,
applied also to his tribe, he resented, the arrow-head and
tomahawk, everywhere found upon sites of ancient
camps and fishing-grounds, tell of the long centuries of his
possession. His memory lingers in the name and poetry
of our Indian summer; and in that most delightful of
autumnal seasons, when a warm wind blowing from the
abode of the Great Spirit stirs the fields of ripened maize,
we may see, where first the Indian's fancy must have seen
it, a suggestion of his head-dress of feathers in the graceful
motion of the corn-stalks. He is immortalized in
richly melodious names of rivers, streams, and mountains,
and his memory is forever recalled in the yearly growth
of that noblest of American plants, the Indian corn.</p>

<p class="indent">In concluding here our view of the less distinct
though not improbable reference of the carvings on the reverse of
the Lenape stone to the ancient historical traditions of
the Delawares, a brief review of the subject of the foregoing
pages may not be out of place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">We have seen that the stone was found at a
spot situated in the ancient territory of the Delawares, and
where many articles of undoubted Indian workmanship
have been found,&mdash;among them two carved stones,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a>
&mdash;that similar aboriginal carvings of the hairy mammoth have
been discovered in Europe, and that a race of men, relics
of whom have been found on the Delaware river and in
California, and who may or may not have been the ancestors
of the modern Indian, have existed in North America
at the time of the mammoth. Moreover, that as yet
nothing is definitely known as to the antiquity of the
Indians' occupancy of our continent, and that there is no
geological evidence to prove that the mammoth did not
survive in America to a comparatively recent period. We
have seen further that the Indians in several of their
traditions attribute the mammoth bones seen by them on the
Ohio to a great monster who was destroyed by lightning,
and that there is a similarity too strong to be accidental
between the Lenape tradition of the great Buffalo and
the carving on the stone; finally, we may see perhaps
a reference in the carvings on the reverse of the stone
to the early Delaware traditions of their migration to
the eastward and wars with the mound-builders, as detailed
in Heckewelder's account, the "Wallum Olum,"
and David Cusic's history.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h3>STATEMENT OF BERNARD Z. HANSELL.</h3>

<p class="indent">On the writer's second visit to Hansell, the
latter was at his father's farm. He stated that the photographs
shown him were representations of the stone, and said
that he considered that he had been cheated. He had
had no idea of the stone's value, and declared that it
was a "mean trick," the purchase of all his relics&mdash;the
stone included&mdash;for $2.50. When it was explained to
him that Mr. Paxon, the purchaser, had been as ignorant
as he in the matter at the time, he seemed satisfied.</p>

<p class="indent">On the third visit, February 10th, Hansell said:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;I am sure that I found the large piece first, in
the spring of 1872 (the year after my father bought the place&mdash;1871),
and while "ploughing for oats" in the "corner" field, and
near the corner where the by-road joins the Durham road&mdash;the
roots of the last year's corn crop had shortly before been
harrowed out. It was in April. When I saw it, it was lying
on the top of the ground, a little to one side of the furrow. I
stopped and picked it up; it seemed like "something different"
from what I had ever found before. It was dirty&mdash;dirt
stuck to the stone; by rubbing, I could see lines&mdash;"queer
marks" over it. (When I afterward saw it at Mr. Paxon's, the
latter had "cleaned it.")
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;I am certain I saw an animal like an elephant on
it before Mr. Paxon saw the stone. I carried it around a day or two in
my pocket, and then put it in a box along with the other
things; and whatever arrow-heads and other relics I found, I
would put into the same box. The same day, I planted a corn-stalk
into the ground to mark the place&mdash;a shower might wash
out something else, I thought. I left the corn-stalk until the
oats harvest, and then threw a stone there, but I soon came to
know the place by heart. The box with the relics I kept
locked up in my trunk, and I took care to keep it locked,&mdash;there
were so many boys about. In the meantime, I was
married. I showed the relics and stone to my wife, but she
would not remember the elephant on the stone. I might
have showed it to father, or might not, I am not sure. He
would not remember. In the same field, I and others on the
place found arrow-heads, coins (English and American pennies),
and a part of a tomahawk or banner stone (sold to Mr.
Paxon). I did not find any thing else in that field, but "gorget
stones" without inscriptions, and round stone balls, with incisions
on sides, were found near by.</p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;In the spring of 1881, Mr. Paxon asked me whether
I had any Indian relics. I said that I had. I told him I would be
at home on Sunday, and he came the next Sunday afternoon&mdash;about
May or June, as nearly as I can recollect,&mdash;1881. I
brought out the box of relics, and told him that I would sell
him the perfect arrow-heads for ten cents, and the broken ones
for five cents apiece. I had a broken tomahawk and a piece
of another, and I laid them and the stone aside, and said I
thought I would keep them. But he did not take much interest
in the rest, and said he wanted all the relics. He did not
look much at the arrow-heads, but he picked up the stone and
turned it around, and wet his thumb and rubbed it. He did
not say any thing about the stone. I did not much want to
sell him the stone, for I never saw any thing like it before.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;But he said he would take all the relics or none for
$2.50. So I let him have them. At the same time he asked me whether
I had not the other piece; perhaps I had, he said, and did not
know it. I told him that I had not.</p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;About a month after that time, he came by on foot
and asked me whether I had found any thing more? I said that I
had not. "If you do," he said, "keep it and give me the first chance."</p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;I always had the other piece in my mind,
and when I went in the field I used to look for it. I would walk
around the spot in a circle, for I thought some one might
have picked it up and then thrown it away again.</p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;After we had cut the corn in the field, and as I
went in to husk, I happened to pass near the place&mdash;I always remember
the place,&mdash;I was thinking of the other piece, and was hardly
in the field before I picked it up. I noticed the marks and the
shape, and saw at once that it was the missing piece. It had
notches around the edges. I put it in my pocket and laid it in
the drawer. My wife never saw it. It was the little piece. I
was married then and in my own house, and there was nobody
about the house, so I did not lock it up.</p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;This was in the fall&mdash;after the exhibition
at Doylestown (October), in 1881. When I went down to Mr. Paxon's father's,
Squire Paxon's, to pay my tax, on the 9th of November, 1881,
I took this piece along. Young Mr. Paxon was not at home,
but I waited till he came back. I said I had something
"pretty nice" for him, and showed him the missing piece. He
thought when he saw it that I would make him pay pretty
dear for it, but I told him that I would give it to him. I had
not rubbed or cleaned it. He put the pieces together and
said "that is the missing piece." He took me up to his
room and gave me some minerals. I advised him to glue the
pieces together with "hickory cement." I had some of this
cement at home, and offered to give it to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;The next spring I saw the stone again, all washed
and cleaned. It did not look altered&mdash;only clean and rubbed off.
I saw it again this February (1884), when you and Mr. Paxon
came to see me, and I saw no change in it.</p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;I never sold a relic before I sold those to Harry
Paxon, and never knew any one from Philadelphia that took any interest
in Indian relics. I used to give things away to relatives of
mine, often boys&mdash;my cousins, when they came up from town.
They had never seen any thing like an arrow-head before. I
never gave a stone to any one but a relative. William Hansell,
my brother, a little boy, saw me pick up the small piece
of the Lenape Stone. I never heard of any one in this neighborhood
interested in Indian relics before Mr. Paxon.</p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;The first things that I remember giving away were
a couple of black arrow-heads that I gave to James Aikens, in 1871.
He lives in Germantown. This was before I found the stone.</p>

<p class="indent space-above">The writer questioned Hansell's wife.
She remembered his having shown her the relics before they were sold to
Mr. Paxon, but had paid no attention to "these little stones
he picks up," and did not remember whether "this stone
you are talking about" was among them or not. The
writer also questioned Hansell's father and mother.
Neither had seen the stone. The boy, William Hansell,
brother of Bernard, said that he had seen the little piece
when Bernard picked it up, but had never seen the large
piece of the stone. The piece he had seen was covered
with dirt and mud, and had "half a hole" in it. Bernard
had told him that he was going to give it to Mr. Paxon.

<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. HENRY D. PAXON.</h3>

<p class="blockquot indent">I remember Hansell telling me of his Indian relics
at my father's office. I went to see him on a Sunday, and he showed
me, in the wood-shed, a tobacco-box half full of relics, among
them the large piece of the Lenape Stone. At the time I never
realized what it was. It was covered with dirt, as were all the
relics. There must have been about two hundred arrow-heads,
broken and perfect, besides a broken axe and fragments of a
banner stone, and one or two large spears and so-called
"gigs." The stone struck me as an extraordinary Indian
relic. Buying the relics, I brought them home that Sunday
afternoon, and at once showed them to my father. He
saw the elephant. Whether I had noticed it before I cannot
remember. Mr. John S. Ash saw this first piece&mdash;the large
piece&mdash;before Capt. Bailey saw it. I showed it to any and
everybody that came to my father's office, but can only be sure
now of Mr. Ash. Capt. Bailey saw it and borrowed it while preparing
his article. I had it at the Bucks County Bi-Centennial
Exhibition, August 31, September 1 and 2, 1882. I did not
particularly value the stone until I read Capt. Bailey's article.
I cleaned out the soil which clung to the stone with a toothbrush,
and may also have used a stick&mdash;but I think not a nail.</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. ALBERT PAXON.</h3>

<p class="blockquot indent">Young Hansell and his father were at my house on
business (I am Justice of the Peace). They had rented a house. I think
it was on a Saturday in '80 or '81, in the summer. The next
day my son went to Hansell's and brought back a large number
of Indian relics. He had invested two or three dollars in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
them. In the lot was one of the pieces of the stone. I remember
saying that it was a pity he had not the other half. The lines
were not cleaned out. I recollect the elephant. He emptied
the relics on the floor of the piazza. It was early summer, and
warm weather&mdash;about May or June,&mdash;and I think on Sunday. I
am certain of having seen the elephant the first day he got the
stone. Bernard Hansell, I find in my book, paid his tax November
8, '81, but I am not positive in these dates to a day.
There is not, and never has been, to my knowledge, any strange
or suspicious person of an "archæological turn" in this neighborhood,
and there is no one here clever enough to have made the stone.</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. JOHN S. ASH, OF GREENVILLE,</h3>
<p class="f120"><b>NOVEMBER 8, 1884.</b></p>

<p class="blockquot indent">At the time of my first seeing the Lenape Stone,
I observed an elephant or mammoth carved upon the fragment. I cannot
now fix the date of my first seeing this piece. Probably it was
some three years since, though it may not be two and may be
four. I think it was before the Bucks County Bi-Centennial Exhibition.</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF CAPT. J. S. BAILEY.</h3>

<p class="blockquot indent">I saw the stone first, I think, in November,
in the fall of 1881, and a few days after Mr. Paxon had obtained the
second piece. He had said to me that he had a curious stone which he
wished to show me. I remember his mentioning the figure of a
turtle, a snake, and an elephant carved on the stone, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
he did not first mention the elephant figure or show that he
appreciated the mammoth. It was not till he had read my
article in the county newspaper that he came to know the
value of the carving. He was only eighteen or nineteen then,
and I believe would have sold the stone for a comparatively
trifling sum. As soon as I took the stone home, after Mr.
Paxon had lent it to me, all my family saw it. Judge Paxon,
his uncle, did not realize its archæological importance, neither
did Mr. Paxon, the owner's father. I showed it to Judge
Paxon before I wrote the article. The first time Mr. Harry
Paxon showed me the stone I remember his saying that "he
could sell it for five dollars." He wanted me to glue or
cement the pieces together, but I discountenanced the plan.
I think he must have scraped out the original soil clinging to
it with a nail or some sharp instrument, and I told him that
he had cleaned the lines too much and that the stone
had lost the look of age. The next time I saw it he had
filled the lines with clay, and this I advised him to remove,
as it did not resemble the soil of the original field. So
the next time I saw it he had cleaned it again. I took the
stone to the January or April meeting of the Bucks County
Historical Society, 1882, and showed it to all the members present.
I showed it to Gen. Davis, who advised me in connection
with it to prepare an article on the Indian relics found
in Bucks County, to be read before the July meeting at Penn's
Manor. A few days after that I returned the stone to Mr.
Paxon. Somewhere in June or July (1882) I borrowed it
again, and kept it until two or three weeks after the meeting at
Pennsbury. This meeting was on the third Tuesday in July,
1882. Mr. Paxon did not go to the meeting, but after reading
my article in the paper he set a higher value on his relic and
wished me to return it. I do not recollect seeing either part
separately. The two pieces were together when I first saw it.
I think Hansell told me that the large part had been found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
first. Very many people saw the stone at my lecture at Penn's
Manor. I had a large diagram of the inscription, several feet
long. Two hundred people must have seen it. There was
an article in the Bucks County <i>Intelligencer</i> about it, and it
was at the Bi-Centennial and there seen by everybody.</p>

<p class="indent">Letter from Dr. D. G. Brinton, Professor of Archæology
and Ethnology in the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>To the Editor of the Bucks County "Intelligencer"</i>:</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">The discussion in your paper about the
so-called "Lenape Stone," in which my name has incidentally been
introduced, leads me to address you a few lines on some archæological
points, especially on the methods of distinguishing genuine
from fabricated specimens. I shall only refer to the Lenape
Stone by way of illustration. It was first shown to me by
Professor Lewis, and after a careful inspection I pronounced
it a modern piece of work, which opinion has been substantiated
by later observers. My opinion was based, first, on the
design, and secondly, on the execution. It may be laid down
as a rule, holding good in all aboriginal designs of the Eastern
United States, that no lines indicating either shading or
rounding are found on figures of pure native origin. Every
line was significant, and nothing was done for affect. Grouping
was also unknown, and any such triple arrangement as the
brute, the human, and the divine groups, standing in immediate
relation to each other and forming parts of a picture, as
appears on the Lenape Stone, was as far above aboriginal
æsthetic conceptions as the Sistine Madonna would be above
the execution of a sign-painter. Certain artistic details, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
lightnings shooting in various directions from a central point
(as from the hand of Jove), were also unknown to the art
notions of the red race. The treatment of the sun as a face,
with rays shooting from it, I also consider foreign to the
pictography of the Delaware Indians, nor have I yet seen any
specimens proved to be of their manufacture that present it.
It is found, indeed, in Chippeway pictography, but there only
in late examples.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">The execution of such imitations also usually
betrays their origin. The lines on the Lenape Stone are obviously cut with
a metal instrument, making clean incisions, deepest in the
centre and tapering to points&mdash;quite different from the scratch
of a flint point. Shrewder fabricators than the unknown
author of this one make use of flint points. Some of the
Western "tablets" have been so inscribed. They may thus
conceal their tools, but there are other resources for the
archæologist. The surface of all stones undergoes a certain
chemical change on exposure to the air, which is called by the
French term <i>patine</i>. In many varieties, as flints, jasper, and
hard shales, this affords a decisive means of discriminating a
modern from an ancient inscription or arrow-head. It requires
the use of the microscope and some practice, but with these
most of such impostures can be detected. This does not
exhaust the resources at the command of the antiquary to circumvent
those who would practise on his love for relics of the
past. But I have said enough to show that opinions on relics
need neither be vague nor prejudiced. It is most desirable
that the citizens of our Commonwealth should take an earnest
interest in the collection of our aboriginal remains, and it is
gratifying to learn that Bucks County is not behindhand in
this direction.</p>

<p class="indent">Letter from Dr. F. W. Putnam, Curator of the Peabody
Museum of Archæology, Cambridge, Mass.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Cambridge</span>, March 17, 1884.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Mercer</span>:</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">In answer to your request, I put on paper a few
thoughts in relation to the carved gorget of slate said to have been
found in Bucks Co., Penna. It is needless to say that I have examined
the stone with great care; for if it is a work of prehistoric
times in America, it is a specimen of very great archæological
interest. The first impression I received was that it
was probably a fraud. This was of course natural, after having
seen several gorgets with figures carved upon them which
were unquestionable frauds. I therefore first of all examined
the stone, and was sorry to find that it had been so much
cleaned, and rubbed, and scrubbed, and probably oiled, that
no evidence could be derived from the character of the lines
cut upon the surface of the stone, or from the stone itself, bearing
upon its antiquity. So far as the testimony of the stone itself
is concerned, the lines may have been cut within a few weeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
or many years ago. Throwing out of consideration all the
facts you have given me in relation to the history of the stone
as known to you, I am left with the character of the carvings
alone upon which to draw conclusions. From a study of these
I get the following results:</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">1st. The person who carved the stone must
have been familiar with the appearance of an elephant or mammoth,
either from having seen one or the other in life or represented
in pictures. There is too much expression given to the details
of outline of forehead, curve of back and belly, and position of
the legs, representing the animal as walking, to be the work of
one who only knew the animal from a general description
handed down by tradition.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">2d. Most of the other figures on both sides of the
stone are of a character common to Indian picture-writing, but there are
a few which, like the "mammoth," show an appreciation of
details or ideas unlike any I can recall in Indian picture-writings.
Take, for example, the fish on the edge of the small
piece, and the long eel-like figure by the side of the bird&mdash;each
of these have a few hair-lines drawn from the back as if
to represent the rays of fins, in order to impress the character
of a fish, although the rays are out of natural position. The
figure of a man on his back under the foot of the "mammoth"
is not drawn in the usual conventional manner, like the figure
of the man with the bow.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">3d. The idea of the heavens, conveyed by the figures
of stars, moon, and sun, is probably not an unusual way of representing
the sky or the heavens, but the mass of crossed lines
near the sun, which are supposed to represent lightning, seems
to me to be more the conventional symbol of the white man
than the Indian.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Considering all these points I draw these conclusions:</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">1st. The carvings were made in ancient times by an
Indian of superior artistic skill, who had seen a living mammoth, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
who wished to preserve some myth or tradition relating to the
animal, in picture-writing upon his gorget; or,</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">2d. The carvings were made by an Indian in comparatively
recent times, with the same idea of preserving a myth about
the "great beast," and he was aided in his work by some
white man; or,</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">3d. That the carving is the work of some white man
in very recent times, who may or may not have known of the myth
and tradition of the Indians relating to the "mammoth."</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">An attempt to read the stone as a pictograph illustrating
the myth of the "great beast" may be going too far, but if it can
be shown to be a piece of Indian work beyond reasonable
doubt, the interpretation of the figures in that connection is
certainly legitimate from the remarkable coincidence between
them and the myth.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">I certainly hope you will bring every possible evidence
to bear in your work, and that by a study of many pictographs
you will be able to test the doubtful figures on the stone.</p>

down on one side, and ends against the fractured portion
opposite. This appears to have been made after the fracture
by holding the pieces together. It is very remarkable that the
line of fracture should cross the specimen at the only place it
could and intersect the minimum number of the lines of carving.
Even in two of those cuts, the fracture breaks across the

Letter from Dr. F. W. Putnam referring to the
two carved stones (figs. 19 and 20) found on the Hansell Farm
in the summer of 1884.</p>
<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Cambridge, Mass.</span>, Oct. 30, 1884.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Mercer</span>:</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">I have examined the two specimens you have
placed in my hands from the Hansell Farm, Bucks Co., Penn., and see no
reason to doubt their authenticity. The lines cut upon them
seem to have been made a long time since, as exhibited by the
weatherings within the incisions. One stone seems first to have
been designed for a perforated ornament, but not completed,
and was afterwards used as a rubbing implement, as shown by
the notches on the edge. The other stone is of a natural form,
in which two holes have been drilled, and on one surface a
number of waves and zig-zag lines were cut, evidently for the
purpose of using the stone for an ornament.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent">The reader is referred to a series of articles mentioning
the Lenape Stone in the Bucks County <i>Intelligencer</i> of
August 9, 23, and 30, and September 20, 1884, and
headed, "Who Perpetrated the Forgery?" also to a personal
discussion which took place in the columns of that
newspaper between the owner of the Stone and Mr. H. C.
Lewis, of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia,
in which arise various questions of veracity as to the facts
of an interview which had taken place between them&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
whether Mr. Lewis had or had not wished to buy the
Stone, and how long he had been allowed the loan of it;
whether he had or had not been permitted to take photographs;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and whether he or Mr. Paxon had scratched the
surface of the Stone "to see its inside structure."</p>

<p class="indent">After a fair consideration of every fact bearing
upon the case, and with ample knowledge to judge of the
particulars of this interview at the time it took place,
personal considerations prevent the writer from discussing
the merits of this controversy, purely personal in its nature
and irrelevant to the question before us.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>EVIDENCE OF AN HONEST DISCOVERY.</h3>

<p class="indent">The first evidence to be certain of in a case
of this kind is doubtless that deducible from the circumstances
attending the discovery itself, and upon it, in the present
instance, for the reason that the Stone has been cleaned,
and all vestiges of the soil which originally clung to it
unfortunately removed, we must chiefly depend.</p>

<p class="indent">The fact that several persons saw the first fragment
immediately after it left Hansell's hands, throws back the
period of possible doubt as to its authenticity to the nine
years of his ownership, while the remarkable skill and
archæological knowledge necessary to forge such a stone
place him as the possible maker of the carvings above the
slightest suspicion. The motive of gain must be eliminated
from the possibilities of the case, when we consider
the trifling sum received by Hansell for the relics, and
the fact that the small piece was presented by him to the
present owner, while the supposition that he could have
been in collusion with any person unknown for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of a practical joke is rendered impossible by his
own honest simplicity and the conduct of his family and
friends throughout. Again, no one clever enough to
have made the relic could have been a neighbor of
Hansell's and remained unknown or unsuspected, and it
is quite absurd to suppose that some one from a distance,
having entrusted the fortunes of so elaborate a practical
joke to the fragments of this small stone, would have
"planted" the results of his labor in Buckingham Township,
Bucks County, where the chances were very strongly
against its being brought to the notice of archæologists,
even if discovered.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>OBJECTIONS OF ARCHÆOLOGISTS.</h3>

<p class="indent">From the <i>a-posteriori</i> point of view&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
from the character and appearance of the carving, there
are objections which have been considered important to the
Stone's authenticity; these the writer has carefully noted,
and will allow them to speak for themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">First, in the opinion of Messrs. M. E. Wadsworth,
of Cambridge, and Joseph P. Iddings, of the United States
Coast Survey, the carvings were made after the Stone was
broken. The fact is proved, they say, by the appearance
of certain lines crossing the fracture, as in the case of the
lightning above the hole on the right, which, when exposed
to the microscope, seem as they cross to descend into it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, the fracture, they say, crosses the minimum
number of carvings as if they had been arranged with
reference to it.</p>

<p class="indent">Thirdly, the mammoth on the Stone resembles the
La Madeleine carving.</p>

<p class="indent">As to the first point&mdash;the carving being later
than the fracture,&mdash;Dr. F. W. Putnam (of the Peabody Museum,
Cambridge, Mass.) observes, on the other hand: "It is
possible that an Indian might have made his carving on a
broken gorget, and there is no reason why he should have
discontinued his work if the gorget were broken during
the carving, a likely thing to happen,"&mdash;nor, we may add,
need it be difficult to suppose that the Indian would have
glued the pieces together or cleaned out the grooves
crossing the fracture. In such a case the instrument
would naturally have broken somewhat into the fracture&mdash;"sinking
down," as Dr. Wadsworth says, "and ending
against the fractured portion opposite," while the subsequent
weathering and brushing might account for the
slight difference in level of the lines on either side of the
break. Again, supposing the mammoth carving to have
been made before the fracture, the carvings on the reverse
of the Stone, and the apparently meaningless scratch
below the perforation, which, as it were, skips the fracture,
may have been made long after it. As Dr. Putnam says:
"The fact that a very large number of perforated stones
are broken when found is worthy of consideration, and
also that in most cases the fracture is through one of the
holes." As regards the resemblance of the mammoth on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the Stone to the La Madeleine carving, a point which after
a careful examination of all the facts struck Professor
Shaler, of Harvard, as suspicious, there is certainly in the
outline of the tail and the indicisive drawing of the back
a great similarity in the treatment of the two figures;
while, on the other hand, as Dr. Charles Rau, of the
Smithsonian Institute, supposes, the resemblance may
perhaps be ascribed to accident, the drawing of the head,
ear, trunk, and hair being, as he suggests, totally dissimilar.
The seeming repetition of the outline of the back in the
two figures may perhaps be looked upon as a suggestion
of the mane-like ridge of hair, which, as seen in some
of the reconstructions, extended along the back of the
animal from the neck to the tail; and it may be observed
that any two profile drawings of the same animal, as realistic
as the above, would naturally possess striking points
of resemblance. Dr. D. G. Brinton, of the Academy of
Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, objects, in a letter above
quoted to the Bucks County <i>Intelligencer</i>, that "no lines
indicating shading or rounding are found in the aboriginal
designs of pure native origin in the Eastern United
States," that in these designs grouping was unknown, and
that "any such triple arrangement as the brute, the human,
and the divine groups standing in immediate relation to
each other and forming parts of a picture, was far above
aboriginal æsthetic conceptions," that "lightnings shooting
from a central point (as from the hand of Jove) were
unknown to the art-notions of the red race," and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
"the treatment of the sun as a face with rays shooting
from it, I also consider foreign to the pictography of the
Delaware Indians; nor have I yet seen any specimens
proved to be of their manufacture that present it. It is
found, indeed, in Chippeway pictography, but there only
in late examples."</p>

<p class="indent">To this we can only say that nothing is more
common than "grouping" in the pictography of our modern
Western Indians, while the more ancient pictographs of
the pre-Columbian Indian, a study of which would be
necessary in forming definite opinions, as to their character,
have been almost entirely lost to us.</p>

<p class="indent">These were probably very rarely carved upon
stone or made upon any thing but the most perishable materials,
and few have survived the bigotry or indifference of the
early settlers and explorers. Their character is, we think,
not fully represented by the meagre data furnished us
from the allusions of the early writers, the Chippeway
bark records, the "wallum olum," or the rock inscriptions
now within the student's reach, and from which we are left
to draw our conclusions as to the evolution of "grouping"
or "shading," or the ability of the Indian to treat
the sun, moon, and stars, or lightning.</p>

<p class="indent">There could have been no great mental chasm,
we think, between the æsthetic conceptions of the modern Sioux
or Comanche, who pictures a buffalo hunt on his robe,
and those of his pre-Columbian red brother, who, as Loskiel
says, painted his "bedeutende figuren" on the trees
of a Pennsylvania forest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Domenich says, in the "History of North America," p. 426:</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"We have seen painted upon bark the
representation of a Chippeway emigration, passing through rivers,
forests, and mountains, on their way from the borders of
a lake to a more civilized country; above the river were
creeks and trees, symbols of forests, and tumuli indicating
mountains; finally, on top of the picture a dozen animals,
totems of the Chippeway chiefs, each with a heart in his breast."</p>

<p class="indent">The same author says, again: "One seldom sees
a garment on which there is not a drawing in black, yellow,
red, white, or blue, representing guns, lances, heads of
hair, arrows, shields, the sun, moon, men, horses, roads,
etc., and sometimes mythological objects."</p>

<p class="indent">Possessed as we elsewhere find of a considerable
power of delineation of which our present extremely insufficient
vestiges can give us no adequate idea, and having already
conceived the idea of a "brute, human, and divine group"
in his numerous traditions of a great monster, the enemy
of man, destroyed by divine wrath and lightnings, we can
by no means think that the ancient Delaware would have
found it more difficult than the Chippeway mentioned
above, to express his conception in a rude picture involving
such a triple grouping.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>TREATMENT OF THE SUN IN INDIAN PICTOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p class="indent">As to the "treatment of the sun," we find faces
with rays, or divergent curves, in Schoolcraft, vol. i., p. 362,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
figs. 16 and 17, and p. 409, fig. 9; vol. iii., p. 493,&mdash;a circle
with rays in the rock inscription (Delaware perhaps) on
the Susquehanna near the Maryland line, a face without
rays in the rock inscription (also Delaware, possibly) at Safe
Harbor on the Susquehanna, and a face with rays, the
counterpart of the carving in question, on a small broken
tablet found near Akron, Ohio, in the collection of the
late Mr. Dupont, of Philadelphia, who had no doubt of
its authenticity.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>LIGHTNING IN INDIAN PICTOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p class="indent">The marks in the picture evidently representing
forked lightning, and directed as in the language of the tradition
at the forehead of the beast, are without parallel among
the Indian pictographs within the writer's reach. The
symbolic snake, or barbed zig-zag of the Moquis&mdash;the
only Indian lightning that the writer has been able to find&mdash;differs
greatly from this, yet there seems no good reason
why the Indian should not have sometimes represented
lightning as he saw it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>LINES CUT BY STEEL AND FLINT INSTRUMENTS.</h3>

<p class="indent">As to the steel-cut appearance of the lines,
Dr. Brinton says: "The lines on the Lenape Stone are obviously
cut with a steel instrument, making clean incisions, deepest in
the centre and tapering to points, quite different from the
scratch of a flint point"; and Dr. M. E. Wadsworth thinks
that "the depth and regularity of the carvings indicate
that they were made with some dulled steel tool like an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
awl." On the other hand Mr. J. E. Iddings does not
know whether it is possible thus to distinguish the work
of steel and flint instruments, and a series of experiments
with the microscope and steel and flint points has induced
the writer to believe that lines cut on a similar stone by
"a dulled steel instrument" and a flint arrow-point cannot
be distinguished after both have been washed and scrubbed.</p>

<p class="indent">The appearance of such lines would of course
depend much upon the sharpness of the flint or steel point, the
kind of stone used, and whether the lines were cut by one
or by a series of strokes. The single scratch of a scissors
point on a shale tablet of similar hardness makes an incision
in shape like the letter V; that of either an awl or
flint arrow-head one like the letter U; while any line
made by either instrument and consisting of a series of
strokes will have its bottom furrowed by parallel grooves,
as in the case of the large lines on the Lenape Stone.</p>

<p class="indent">The fresh flint-cut grooves, however, when
separately examined with the microscope, exhibit many faint
scratches running along the furrow, not so conspicuous in
the steel incisions, yet a few applications of soap, water,
and a scrubbing-brush efface these scratches in both cases,
and render the surface of the grooves indistinguishably
alike and in appearance similar to the now polished
incisions upon the Lenape Stone. In other respects the
scratch of the arrow-head can be made of equal depth,
clearness, and regularity, the flint point, if held carefully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
not appearing to tear the edges of the incision more than
the awl. Moreover, we can cause the flint-cut line to
"taper to a point" or not, as we choose.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>NEWLY DISCOVERED INDIAN CARVINGS FROM THE HANSELL FARM.</h3>

<div class="figright">
  <img src="images/fig-19.jpg" alt="Gorget" width="300" height="224" />
<p class="f90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Carved "Gorget" from the Hansell Farm.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Strongly in support of the authenticity of the
Lenape Stone and its honest discovery, are the two carved stones,
figs. 19 and 20, recently discovered on the Hansell Farm,
while the present paper was preparing, and proving that,
however rare in other localities, small stones
were not infrequently carved in this neighborhood.
Dr. Putnam "sees no reason to doubt their authenticity,"
and Professor Shaler, of Harvard College, to whom the writer has
shown fig. 19, says: "If, upon comparing the incised lines with
those on the Lenape Stone, it appears that they have the
same character&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the same shape of
furrow,&mdash;then you will undoubtedly add a good deal to the weight
of evidence in favor of the antiquity of the other ornament."</p>

<p class="indent">Considering, however, the variety of lines which
may be cut with a flint instrument, we would hesitate to assign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
great importance to this comparison. An examination
with the microscope proves that the lines on the gorget,
fig. 19, are not so neatly and deeply cut as those on the
Lenape Stone, and that the bottoms of the grooves are
more rounded. While most of the lines on the banner stone,
fig. 20, "tapering into points," seem as deeply and clearly
cut as those of the mammoth outline, the microscope
shows few, if any, scratches on the surface of the grooves,
which bear all the traces of long exposure to the weather.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="f90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>&mdash;Carved Banner Stone from the Hansell Farm.</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>OPINION OF INDIANS.</h3>

<p class="indent">The writer has made several efforts to obtain
opinions upon the Lenape Stone from modern Indians, particularly
Delawares, in the West and in Canada. Mr. Horatio
Hale, of Toronto, who kindly showed photographs of the
carvings to several Indians in Canada, among whom were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
some very intelligent Delawares, says that "they thought
that the Stone showed Indian workmanship, and would
have been inclined to consider it authentic but for the
mammoth, which perplexed them. They had never heard
of such a creature, and, fearing a hoax, were shy of saying
much about the symbols on the reverse side of the Stone;
the pipes would naturally, they said, indicate a treaty;
the snow-shoe, that some of the tribes concerned came
from the North; and the tortoise, hawk, deer, etc., would
be the marks or totems of the different tribes; with regard
to the doubtful figures, they could give no explanation."</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, the value of these opinions would
in each case depend upon the tribe to which the Indian belonged,
and how far his former knowledge of a pictographic art or
the traditions of his race may have been lost by many
years of contact with the whites.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>INDIAN PIPE-FORMS.</h3>

<p class="indent">The strong resemblance of the pipe figure (<i>l</i>)
to the modern Sioux calumets, made of catlinite or red pipe-stone
from the famous quarry in Southwestern Minnesota,
has been spoken of as another objection to the authenticity
of the Stone. The form does not occur, as far as
the writer can learn, in any of the ancient rock-writings of
the eastern Algonkins, and no pipes of exactly the Sioux
shape, which Mr. E. A. Barber, of Philadelphia, considers
the most modern of Indian pipe-forms, have as yet been
discovered in the ancient Delaware era, nor even in the mounds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/fig-21.jpg" alt="Indian Pipes" width="600" height="224" />
<p class="f90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></p>

  <img src="images/fig-22.jpg" alt="Indian Pipes" width="300" height="178" />
<p class="f90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="indent">On the other hand, the profile of the Sioux form
itself could not more closely correspond with the minute outline,
which is too small, perhaps, to be taken very strictly,
than does the <i>profile</i> of fig. 21&mdash;a pipe now in the
Archæological Museum, at Salem, Mass., and found by
Dr. Putnam, in an ancient Indian grave near Beverly, Mass.</p>

<p class="indent">The other pipe figure on the stone might
easily have been suggested by the form from the
mounds, with a slightly curved base (fig. 22), now in
the Peabody Museum at Cambridge, Mass., and discovered
in a mound in Ohio.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>INDIAN PICTURE-WRITING.</h3>

<p class="indent">Schoolcraft, who has been more explicit than other
writers respecting the picture-writings of the North American
Indians, speaks of two distinct pictographic systems
among the Algonkin tribes, called by them respectively
<i>Kekeewin</i> and <i>Kekeenowin</i>. The first appeared to be their
method of recording facts of every-day occurrence, and
embraced the heraldic devices used upon the grave posts&mdash;the
communications written upon birch bark, and the
caution marks, itinerary, hunting, and war records inscribed
upon the trunks of blazed trees by travelling
bands, to communicate intelligence to their comrades in
the forest. These writings, the signs of which were carefully
taught to the young, like the language of signs common
at present to a majority of the Western tribes, could
be understood by any Indian. Loskiel, the Moravian
missionary, who makes frequent mention of picture
records, states that "it gave the Indians great pleasure if
one halted on coming to such a tree, and listened to their
description of the great chief and his exploits thereon inscribed."</p>

<p class="indent">The Kekeenowin, on the other hand,&mdash;the pictographic
system of the prophets, jugglers, and medicine-men,&mdash;was
far less generally understood by the Indians themselves.
It was the method used in the historical records, sung before
the tribe at religious feasts and dances, and was likewise
invariably employed in the incantations of the priests,
prophets, and medicine-men, of which Schoolcraft gives
seven kinds relating to medicine, necromancy, revelry,
hunting, prophecy, war, and love.</p>

<p class="indent">The chief characteristic of the Kekeenowin is
the fact that in it each symbol recalled to the mind of the reader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
learned in the art a song, previously committed to memory
by him in connection with the symbol, and the general
idea of which was more or less arbitrarily connected
with it. "The words of the song," says James, in his
appendix to Tanner's narrative, "were not variable, but
must be learned by heart, otherwise though from an inspection
of the figure the idea might be comprehended,
no one would know what to sing." The main object, however,
was the preservation of the songs, which the priests,
on consulting their birch-bark scrolls or painted wooden
tablets, were thus enabled to sing at the great feasts,
giving the many verses in their proper order. The connection
between the symbol and the idea expressed by
the song was often beyond the power of divination to the
uninitiated, and the key to these sacred incantations, a
knowledge of the songs, once lost, could never be recovered,
as it was doubtless far from the intention of the
priests that the uninitiated Indian should divine their
mysteries from an inspection of the symbols. It was only
upon the payment of many beaver skins, says Tanner in
his narrative, that he was permitted to learn the mystic
signification of the twenty-seven symbols of the Chippeway
song for medicine hunting, which it took him more than a
year to learn.</p>

<p class="indent">The historical records, however, were sometimes,
it appears, written in Kekeewin and sometimes in Kekeenowin;
some were related in songs, others were not.
Those inscribed upon painted wooden tablets, or the bark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
scrolls, and pieces of slate alluded to by George Copway,
were doubtless generally sung at stated occasions before
the tribe, while the Muzzinabicks or rock-writings upon
the face of cliffs and boulders, as at "Bald Friars" and
"Miles Island" on the Susquehanna or West River, and
Bellows Falls, Vermont, at the Cunningham Islands, Lake
Erie, or upon the famous Dighton Rock at Fall River,
Mass., although including many of the characters seen in

<h3>TRADITION OF THE GREAT BUFFALO.</h3>

<p class="indent">Another version of the big-buffalo tradition
is found in Rembrandt Peale's pamphlet on the mammoth, published
in Philadelphia in 1803. Notwithstanding the highly
colored style of the translation the ideas expressed seem
to be those of the Indian. It reads as follows: "Ten thousand
moons ago, when naught but gloomy forests covered
this land of the sleeping sun, and long before the pale
men, with thunder and fire at their command, rushed on
the wings of the wind to ruin this garden of nature, when
naught but the untamed wanderers of the woods, and men
as unrestrained as they, were lords of the soil, a race of
animals existed, huge as the frowning precipice, cruel as
the bloody panther, swift as the descending eagle, and
terrible as the angel of night. The pines crashed beneath
their feet, and the lake shrunk when they slaked their thirst;
the forceful javelin in vain was hurled, and the barbed arrow
fell harmless by their side. Forests were laid waste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
at a meal, the groans of expiring animals were everywhere
heard, and whole villages, inhabited by men, were destroyed
in a moment. The cry of universal distress extended
even to the region of peace in the west, and the
Good Spirit interposed to save the unhappy. The forked
lightning gleamed aloud, and loudest thunder rocked the
globe. The bolts of heaven were hurled upon the cruel
destroyers alone, and the mountains echoed with the bellowings
of death. All were killed except one male, the
fiercest of the race, and him even the artillery of the
skies assailed in vain. He ascended the bluest summit
which shades the source of the Monongahela, and roaring,
aloud, bid defiance to every vengeance. The red lightning
scorched the lofty firs, and rived the knotty oaks,
but only glanced upon the enraged monster. At length,
maddened with fury, he leaped over the waves of the
west at a bound, and at this moment reigns the uncontrolled
monarch of the wilderness, even in despite of omnipotence itself."</p>

<h3>THE CHEROKEES AND CHOCTAWS DESCENDANTS OF THE MOUND-BUILDERS.</h3>

<p class="indent">If the account of Cusic and the Lenape traditions
concur in solving the mystery of the mound-builders, and
proving their identity with the Allegewi of the Lenape
tradition, the evidence is strengthened by the concurrent
testimony of language, which, as Mr. Hale and others
have shown, renders it probable that the conquered race,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
fleeing down the Mississippi, were received and adopted
by the Choctaws and Cherokees, who thus became in part
their descendants. Both the language of the Cherokees
lying to the southeast of the mound-builders' dominions,
and who claim to have built the Grave Creek mound, and
that of the Choctaws lying to the southwest, have in their
vocabularies been largely recruited from a similar foreign
linguistic element. One remnant of the Allegewi mingling
with their conquerors, the Talamatan or Hurons, became
in part the ancestors of the Cherokees. Living to the
southeast of the mound-builders' dominions, the Cherokees
had their council lodge on the summit of a vast
mound, the construction of which they ascribed to a
people who had preceded them. In grammar their
language resembled the Huron-Iroquois, while in vocabulary
it has been largely recruited from some foreign source.</p>

<p class="indent">The other remnant of the vanquished Allegewi,
fleeing down the Mississippi "to the southward," would have
been received and protected by the warlike Choctaws,
themselves a mound-building people in comparatively recent
times, and the peculiar foreign element in whose
language, which differs considerably from that of the
sister Creek and Chicasaw nations, would thus be explained.

<h3>CARVED "GORGET" FOUND ON THE HANSELL FARM,</h3>
<p class="f120"><b>JANUARY 8, 1885.</b></p>

<p class="indent">While the foregoing pages were in course of
publication, the carved "gorget" (fig. 23) was found on the
Hansell farm, on Thursday, January 8, 1885.</p>

<p class="indent">The circumstances of the discovery were as follows:
Late in the autumn of last year&mdash;1884&mdash;the writer had
caused an excavation to be made at a spot in one of the
fields on the Hansell property, where the carved stone
(<a href="#Page_83">fig. 19</a>) had been found. At this place the soil of the
field, a yellowish clay, was very noticeably discolored as if
by the fires and decayed refuse of aboriginal dwellings; the
discolored spot was of a dark brown color, and covered an
area of about twenty square yards.</p>

<p class="indent">The excavation measured about 25 feet in length
by 4&frac12; feet in width, and about 3 feet in depth. The dark
brown stratum had a depth of 1&frac12; to 2 feet, and beneath
it appeared the yellow clay of the surrounding field. The
place was at a distance of about a quarter of a mile from
the spot where the Lenape Stone had been found. In
digging the trench many small stones were thrown up, but
no human remains or implements were discovered. The
earth was not thrown through a sieve. As the excavation
was to have been continued in the spring, the trench and
pile of earth were left undisturbed.</p>

<p class="indent">Bernard Hansell, the discoverer of the Lenape
Stone, states that he found the carved gorget (fig. 23) in this
heap of earth on Thursday the 8th of last month; his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
brother had previously found there several flint chips, and
Hansell had gone to the spot, on the day in question, expressly
to look for "Indian relics."</p>

<p class="indent">The day was warm and the trench full of water.
The field was very muddy. Hansell found the stone, the
perforation in which had attracted his attention, protruding
a little from the mud on the outside of the heap, and
in the yellow earth last thrown out. Without displacing it,
he returned to the house, and brought his brother, William
Hansell, to the spot, that the latter might witness his
discovery. Then removing the stone from the mud, he
washed it in the water of the trench, not rubbing it, but
holding it in the water for about five minutes. The mud
clinging to it, having melted and frozen several times
within a few days, was very soft and dissolved easily. On
the same day Hansell informed the writer of his discovery
in a letter.</p>

<p class="indent">The stone is a soft, red shale, similar in
appearance to the Lenape Stone. Unlike the specimens (<a href="#Page_83">figs. 19</a>
and <a href="#Page_84">20</a>) found on the surface of the ground, its surface presents
a very polished and rubbed appearance, as if it had been
subjected to long wear after the carvings had been made.
The lines, the edges of which are much worn and rubbed,
do not seem sharply and deeply cut, as those of <a href="#Page_84">fig. 20</a>
or the Lenape Stone, and the bottoms of the grooves, to
which the soil still clings, appear rounded, as if cut with a
dull point&mdash;as in the case of the shallow incisions upon <a href="#Page_83">fig. 19</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The discovery of this stone in the clayey soil,
beneath the black stratum above mentioned, and where it had lain
for an indefinite period beyond the reach of the ploughshare,
would account for its polished appearance and the
absence of weathering upon its surface&mdash;the conditions of
its discovery generally corresponding with those in the
case of highly polished implements found in the mounds.</p>

<p class="f90 space-below"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>&mdash;(Natural size) Carved "Gorget"
Found on the Hansell Farm, January 8, 1885.</p>

<p class="indent">The design consists of: (<i>a</i>) three waving lines
representative of water; (<i>b</i>) three points between the perforations,
referring probably to wigwams&mdash;possibly an allusion to
the triple clanship of the Lenapes and their settlement by
the <i>Lenape whittuck</i> or Delaware River; (<i>c</i>) a bow;
(<i>d</i>) an arrow; and (<i>e</i>) a quiver.</p>

<p class="indent">The design on the reverse side, of which we here give
a rough outline (fig. 24) consists mainly of a series of circular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
waving lines, representative probably of water; numerical
dots and "tallies"; and three triangular outlines, common
Indian symbols for the human figure, and again suggestive
perhaps of the Wolf, Turtle, and Turkey brotherhood of the Lenapes.</p>

Nothing seems to contribute so much to the problem of their
use as the absence, in most cases, of any sign of friction around the
holes. Similar stones have been recently seen in use by the Pah-Utes
of Southern Nevada, "for giving uniform size to their bow-strings,"
yet the clean edges of the perforations make it impossible to believe
that these stones could have been used for such a purpose, while the
difficulty of supposing they could have been used as buttons, or that
they could have been suspended at all is almost as great, unless we
adopt the very ingenious theory of Dr. F. W. Putnam, <i>i. e.</i>,
that the raw deer thong used for suspending them, and forced tightly
through the holes, becoming hard when dry, remained motionless in its
place, and rendered friction impossible.</p></div>

Heckewelder states that he had himself seen "many of these fortifications,
&mdash;of course the works of the mound-builders. He mentions in particular
two "entrenchments" along the Huron River, and several large flat mounds
near them, in which were buried, as he learned from the Indians, hundreds
of the Alligewi, slain in the bloody wars which the narrative
proceeds to mention.</p></div>

The point projecting behind the handle in the figure
reminds us forcibly of the shape of the modern iron tomahawk; yet
that stone axes of this shape were anciently in use among the Indians
was proved by the discovery of the "Thorndale Axe" with a similar
projection, and found in the original wooden handle, now at the
Museum of Natural History in New York.</p></div>

The word Namaesi Sipu (Fish River) given by Heckewelder,
but published <i>Messussipu</i> (Great River) in Mr. Squier's version
of the <i>Wallum Olum</i>, appears <i>Namasipi</i> in the Rafinesque
version of 1836, and in the original manuscript now in Dr. Brinton's
possession it seems that the latter word has been written over the word
<i>Messussipu</i> by the author, who probably had been comparing the
account with Heckewelder.</p></div>

On the other hand, how shall we account for the occurrence of the
word <i>Messusipu</i> in the Wallum Olum, or, more exactly, in the
Rafinesque copy of it&mdash;the only version we possess?</p>

<p><i>Messusipu</i> is derived, says Squier, from the Algonkin words
<i>Messu</i>, <i>Messi</i>, or <i>Michi</i> (great), and <i>Sipu</i> (river).</p>

<p>The name <i>Mississippi</i> is of Algonkin origin, and has the same
etymology,&mdash;it means "great river." Among the Algonkin tribes living
to the north and along the eastern shore of the Mississippi, the Sauks
called it <i>Mecha-sapo</i>, the Menomonees <i>Mecha-sepua</i>,
the Kicapoos <i>Meche-sepe</i>, the Chippeways <i>Meze-zebe</i>, and
the Ottawas <i>Missis-sepi</i>; <i>Mecha</i>, <i>Meche</i>,
<i>Meze</i>, <i>Missis</i>, meaning "great," and <i>sapo</i>,
<i>sepua</i>, <i>sepe</i>, <i>zebe</i>, and <i>sepi</i>, "river."
(Wisconsin Hist. Col., ix., 301.)</p>

<p>The Lenape word <i>Messusipu</i> must therefore refer to the
Mississippi. Yet we may suppose that Rafinesque had written the word
by mistake in his copy of the Wallum Olum, a supposition which gains
strength from the fact that <i>Messusipu</i> plainly appears in his
manuscript to have been changed to <i>Namasipi</i>. Had he been
comparing his copy with the original "painted sticks" or some other
Indian authority not mentioned? or did he merely borrow the word
<i>Namasipi</i> from Heckewelder? Again we may suppose the word
<i>Messusipu</i> to have been an indefinite term applied by the Lenape
to more than one of the great streams crossed by them in their migrations.</p></div>
